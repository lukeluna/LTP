"“Houlton has been exploring this possibility for years. Back in 2011, he reported that forest trees can tap into nitrogen found in rock. At the time, he said ‘the stunning finding that forests can also feed on nitrogen in rocks has the potential to change all projections related to climate change,’ because it meant there could be more carbon storage on land and less in the atmosphere than climate models say.”",false causality
