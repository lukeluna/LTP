For each statement, define your classification. Explain your reasoning step by step

Imagine three different experts are doing this classification. All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking, then share it with the group. Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc. If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.
The experts must come to a final agreement.
The answer must just be a level two fallacy class in the exact wording as described above or 'nothing' Write down the final answer as 'final answer: -insert answer-'. Examples: 'final answer: Appeal to Pity (Appeal to Emotion)', 'final answer: Ad Populum (Fallacy of Credibility)' 'final answer: nothing'
