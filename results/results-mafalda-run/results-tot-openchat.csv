explanation: the statement is suggesting that because a certain event (last democrat winning the new hampshire primary) happened before another event (winning the general election), the first event caused or was responsible for the second event. however, this is not necessarily true. there may be other factors at play that are not considered in this statement. therefore, it is a fallacy where cause and effect are assumed based on the order of events without proper reasoning.",False

explanation: the statement ""carbon dioxide hurts nobody's health"" assumes that there is a direct and necessary relationship between carbon dioxide and harm to human health, which is not the case. carbon dioxide itself is not directly harmful; it is the consequences of high levels of carbon dioxide (e.g., from burning fossil fuels) in the atmosphere that lead to climate change, which does have negative impacts on human health. therefore, this statement is an example of a fallacy where a false or overly simplistic cause-and-effect relationship is assumed between two things.",False

55,"This vice president has been an advocate for over a decade for lifting sanctions against Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet.",appeal to fear,"answer: fallacy of false cause

explanation: the statement seems to suggest that the vice president's advocacy for lifting sanctions against iran is caused by iran being a ""state sponsor of terrorism."" however, there could be many other reasons why someone might advocate for lifting sanctions. assigning a single cause (iran being a state sponsor of terrorism) to a complex issue or action is a fallacy of false cause. it simplifies the reasoning and misleads people into thinking there's a direct correlation between iran's actions and the vice president's advocacy, when in reality, it could be based on various other factors such as human rights concerns, economic impact, diplomatic relations, etc.",False

explanation: the fallacy here is that just because the commercial has been made, it must be successful or good. just because something is popular doesn't necessarily mean it is of high quality or will be successful. there could be many reasons for its popularity, such as marketing or timing. therefore, this statement assumes popularity equals success or quality, which is a fallacy.",False

77,"Along the Russian coastline, which makes up more than half the Arctic total, winds and currents push old ice away from potential shipping lanes and prevent the build-up of thicker, multi-year ice that would leave other parts of the Arctic impassable for longer periods.",nothing,"answer: appeal to authority

explanation: the statement refers to ""more than half the arctic total"" without providing any source or evidence to back up this claim. instead, it is making an assertion based on the perceived authority of the speaker. it's a fallacy where someone uses an alleged authority as evidence in your argument when the authority is not really an authority on the facts relevant to the argument.
