0,TITLE: Endless Ledge Skip Campaign for Alts POST: Reading everyone's comments has made me change my opinion on having an adventure mode like thing in PoE.,nothing,"the given statement does not explicitly state a fallacy, but it could be considered as an example of 'groupthink', which is not a classical logical fallacy, but rather a psychological phenomenon where people strive for consensus and conformity over rational decision-making.

here's the reasoning:
1. the scenario describes experts coming to an agreement, indicating a desire for group consensus.
2. if any expert realizes they are wrong at any point, they leave the group, suggesting pressure to conform and avoid admitting mistakes.
3. the process continues until the experts reach a final agreement, reinforcing the idea of conformity over critical thinking.

however, since we're looking for logical fallacies in the provided statement, and not psychological phenomena or other cognitive biases, the answer is 'answer: nothing'.",True
1,I keep seeing if an adventure mode needs to exist then why not just start a char at 68.,slippery slope,"answer: fallacy of false equivalence
explanation: the comparison between ""an adventure mode"" and ""starting a character at level 68"" is not equal or reasonable because they are two different concepts with different implications. the former refers to a gameplay feature, while the latter refers to the starting point of a character in a game. thus, it is incorrect to equate them as if they were equivalent options or solutions to a problem.",False
2,then a couple months after that we'll see post about how people want to start at 90 just so they can kill bosses.,slippery slope,answer: circular reasoning,False
3,"Then a few months later we'll see people asking for a""creative"" mode so they can have access to all items in the game so they don't have to farm, and i dont think that sets a good example as a community for a game that we all love.",slippery slope,answer: appeal to emotion,False
4,"Two of my best friends are really introverted, shy people, and they both have cats.",nothing,answer: nothing,True
5,That leads to me believe that most cat lovers are really shy.,hasty generalization,answer: nothing (as there is no clear fallacy being committed in the statement),False
6,TITLE: There is a difference between a'smurf' and an'alt'.,nothing,answer: nothing (there is no fallacy in this statement as it does not present an argument or reasoning to be classified. it simply describes two different terms.),True
7,Please learn it and stop using them interchangeably.,nothing,answer: answer: circular reasoning,False
8,POST:,nothing,answer: answer: appeal to consensus (or group think),False
9,"Someone once told me they have an""alt"" cause their main account was too high of rank to play with their friends.",false analogy,"answer: equivocation

explanation: the term ""alt"" is ambiguous here, as it can refer to both an alternate account and alternative (another option). it's unclear which interpretation the user intended, creating a misleading argument.",False
10,It's exactly the same as smurfing.,false analogy,answer: answer: false analogy,True
11,TITLE: Discussion Thread (Part 3): 2020 Presidential Race Democratic Debates - Post Debate | Night 2 POST:,nothing,"answer: answer: circular reasoning
explanation: the experts in this scenario are using the agreement of the group as evidence for their own opinions. if one expert leaves, they are effectively saying that their belief is not supported by the group's consensus (which includes themselves), which contradicts the reasoning behind their original decision to stay or leave. thus, a circular argument is created where the justification for the experts' beliefs relies on the very same beliefs.",False
12,Joe Biden will lose to Trump if he is the nominee.,guilt by association,"'answer: false dilemma'

explanation: in this scenario, only two candidates (biden and trump) are presented as the possible outcomes, but it does not account for other factors or possibilities that could influence the election results, such as new candidates entering the race, changes in campaign strategies, shifts in public opinion, etc. therefore, it is a fallacy where only two choices are presented yet more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes.",False
13,The Democratic party clearly has not learned the right lesson from Hillary Clinton's miserable failure.,guilt by association,answer: nothing (this statement does not contain a fallacy as it is stating an opinion rather than providing evidence or reasoning that could be classified as a fallacy),False
14,NOBODY WANTS ESTABLISHMENT POLITICIANS ANYMORE.,causal oversimplification,"'answer: generalization'

explanation: the statement is making a claim about all establishment politicians, but it does not provide evidence or examples to support this claim. therefore, the argument relies on a broad assumption that is not supported by specific instances, resulting in an overly broad and unfounded conclusion.",False
15,NOBODY LIKES THE STATUS QUO.,causal oversimplification,"answer: false dilemma. the statement presents only two possibilities (someone liking or not liking the status quo), while there are other options, such as people being indifferent towards it or having mixed feelings about it.",False
16,Like Jesus Christ you think they would learn.,nothing,answer: straw man,False
17,POST:,nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
18,The status quo in America is that its the best its ever been.,circular reasoning,"the statement is not explicitly presenting a fallacy, but it could be considered an example of 'appeal to tradition' if it is used as an argument without sufficient evidence or reasoning to support the claim that america is currently the best it has ever been. however, since the statement does not include any explicit attempt to use tradition as evidence or reasoning, and only states a fact about the current status quo, it would be more accurate to classify it as 'nothing' in this specific context.",False
19,We live in one of the best societies in the best times that humans have ever experienced.,circular reasoning,"answer: nothing (or 'no fallacy')

explanation: the statement does not provide an argument or conclusion, nor does it offer a premise for criticism. it is merely stating a factual claim about the nature of society and human history, without any comparison or evaluation for the purpose of logical analysis. therefore, there are no elements present to identify a specific fallacy in this statement.",False
20,"America is the best place to live, because it's better than any other country.",circular reasoning,answer: circular reasoning,True
21,Let us move now to the future.,appeal to fear,"'answer: false dilemma'

explanation: in this scenario, only two choices are presented (the experts sharing one step of thinking and then continuing) but there exists a spectrum of possible choices in the way they approach or interpret the problem. for example, one expert might focus on the quantitative aspect while another might concentrate on qualitative factors. this method does not account for these different approaches which could lead to an incorrect conclusion if all experts are not open to various perspectives.",False
22,"It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical...",appeal to fear,answer: circular reasoning,False
23,leaders that the world has ever seen.,appeal to fear,answer: false dilemma,False
24,"That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.",causal oversimplification,answer: answer: begging the question (circular reasoning),False
25,Delores is a big supporter for equal pay for equal work.,guilt by association,answer: answer: appeal to unanimity,False
26,This is the same policy that all those extreme feminist groups support.,guilt by association,answer: guilt by association,True
27,Extremists like Delores should not be taken seriously -- at least politically.,guilt by association,'answer: guilt by association',True
28,"""Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy toothpaste.",appeal to (false) authority,answer: appeal to false authority,False
29,"Therefore, it must be great.""",appeal to (false) authority,"answer: answer: circular reasoning

explanation: the argument relies on the premise that if all experts agree, their conclusion must be correct. however, this conclusion is being used as evidence for the original premise that they must come to a final agreement. this creates a circular reasoning where the proposition is supported by the premises which are themselves supported by the proposition, without any independent evidence or reason provided.",False
30,"TITLE: Gatineau police officer tests positive, but masks still not mandatory at checkpoints POST: Guess what?",nothing,answer: nothing. the statement does not provide information about any fallacy as it is merely stating a fact and does not include any argumentation or reasoning that could be considered a fallacy.,True
31,police need to interact with people at close quarters.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma. the statement suggests that interaction between police and people can only occur at close quarters, but this is not true as there are various ways of communication and interaction without the need for physical proximity, such as phone calls, emails, or video conferences.",False

38,The last Democrat winner of the New Hampshire primary won the general election.,false causality,answer: hasty generalization,False
39,"This year, the winner of the New Hampshire primary will win the general election.",false causality,answer: fallacy of undistributed middle,False
40,Men score better on math than women do.,fallacy of division,answer: nothing (since the statement itself does not provide enough information for us to classify it as a fallacy),False
41,Jerry is a man.,fallacy of division,answer: nothing (no fallacy is present in this statement),False
42,"Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman.",fallacy of division,answer: false equivalence,False
43,TITLE: Sign petition for Persona 5 pc and switch ports POST:,nothing,"'answer: circular reasoning'

explanation: the reasoning in this scenario is circular because the process relies on the experts reaching a final agreement as the end goal. however, to reach that agreement, they need to first classify the issue (in this case, whether or not there should be ports for persona 5 on pc and switch). if they rely on each other's opinions to make their own decisions, it creates a loop where the final decision is based on the premise of reaching an agreement. this is circular reasoning because the conclusion (reaching an agreement) is used as evidence to support the argument (classifying whether there should be ports for persona 5).",False
44,So much important stuff in the world that needs political activism.,appeal to worse problems,answer: appeal to importance,False
45,Makes a petition to portbeg P5 onto PC and Switch.,appeal to worse problems,answer: circular reasoning,False
46,Carbon dioxide hurts nobody' s health.,false analogy,answer: false dilemma,False
47,It' s good for plants.,false analogy,"answer: fallacy of false cause
explanation: the reasoning is that because humans follow a certain process, it implies that this process will have the same effect on plants, which is not supported by evidence or logic.",False

49,Mr. Governor issues a proclamation for the people of his state to pray for rain.,false causality,answer: appeal to emotion,False
50,"Several months later, it rains.",false causality,answer: circular reasoning,False
51,Praise the gods!,false causality,answer: nothing,False
52,Iran has moved forward with its nuclear weapons program.,appeal to fear,"answer: nothing (or ambiguous). the statement itself does not contain a clear fallacy, but it may lead to a fallacious argument if the reasoning behind the statement is based on assumptions or faulty logic, such as circular reasoning, appeal to authority without proper qualifications, or other logical fallacies. without knowing the specific context and reasoning of the experts, it's impossible to determine if the statement itself contains a fallacy or not.",False
53,They're more dangerous today than they were four years ago.,appeal to fear,"answer: nothing (this statement does not contain a fallacy as described in the given context. it is a simple assertion that a group of experts are tasked to evaluate, not an argument with logical flaws.)",False
54,"North Korea has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program, gone from one to two nuclear weapons to six to eight nuclear weapons.",appeal to fear,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement suggests that the only possible choice or action is either ""going"" or ""not going."" however, other actions exist in this scenario, such as diplomatic negotiations, sanctions, and monitoring efforts, among others. this fallacy arises from presenting only two extreme options while overlooking the existence of a spectrum of choices between those extremes.",False
55,"This vice president has been an advocate for over a decade for lifting sanctions against Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet.",appeal to fear,"answer: argument from authority (fallacy)
explanation: the statement asserts that since the vice president is an advocate for lifting sanctions against iran, it means those sanctions are unwarranted because iran is a large state sponsor of terrorism. the reasoning here assumes that because the vice president has been advocating for something for over a decade, they must have substantial knowledge or expertise in the subject. however, this is not necessarily true - a person may advocate for something without having relevant knowledge or expertise. in this case, the argument from authority fallacy occurs when the vice president's position as an advocate is used as evidence to support the claim that lifting sanctions against iran is justified.",False
56,It's a mistake.,appeal to fear,answer: nothing (there is no fallacy in this scenario as described),False
57,"TITLE: Sweden sees higher coronavirus death rate than US after refusing lockdown POST: I wonder how is New York planning on getting out of the lockdown, because when they get out of lockdown probably some cases are going to be going on and the whole infection thing will start again.",nothing,answer: nothing (no fallacy is committed in the statement as it does not present an argument or reasoning with a specific logical error),True
58,POST:,nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
59,You cant stop nature.,appeal to nature,"answer: nothing (there is no identified fallacy in this statement, as it does not present an argument, nor does it involve reasoning.)",False
60,Youre going to be infected if you havent already.,appeal to nature,answer: false dilemma,False
61,We are always trying to fight nature.,appeal to nature,"answer: false dilemma
explanation: the argument presents only one choice (fighting nature) while ignoring other possible choices such as living with, adapting to, or even working in harmony with nature. the argument suggests that the only alternative to fighting nature is doing nothing at all, which is not a realistic option when it comes to human interaction with the natural world.",False
62,We just have to let it run its course.,appeal to nature,answer: circular reasoning,False
63,Jeff is preparing to create a commercial for a new energy drink.,nothing,answer: answer: nothing (as it does not contain a fallacy in the wording as described),True
64,He visits a local high school and surveys students in an English class about their beverage preferences.,nothing,answer: sample survey fallacy,False
65,"The majority of the class says they prefer grape flavored drinks, so Jeff tells his superiors that grape is the flavor favored most by high school students.",hasty generalization,answer: appeal to popularity,False
66,What error in reasoning has Jeff made?,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning
explanation: the experts will have to come to a final agreement means that all of them need to agree, but if any expert realizes they're wrong at any point then they leave. this creates a circular argument because the condition for leaving is based on the agreement (or disagreement) itself. if an expert leaves, it would be due to not reaching an agreement, but that agreement is exactly what the experts are supposed to come to.",False
67,The Freehold Raceway Mall is the best mall because there are always so many cars there.,causal oversimplification,"the statement does not explicitly present a fallacy, but it seems to imply an example of a fallacy known as ""appeal to popularity"" or ""bandwagon appeal"". in this case, the implication is that the number of cars at the mall indicates its quality, which is a logical fallacy because popularity does not necessarily equate to quality. however, since the statement does not explicitly present a sequence of reasoning steps as described in the question, it cannot be classified with certainty.

answer: 'answer: possible appeal to popularity'",False
68,TITLE: Can I get into finance with a Law degree?,nothing,"answer: answer: false dilemma (or maybe straw man, depending on how strict you want to be)

explanation: in the scenario described, it is presented as if there are only two options: either the experts agree or they leave. however, it could very well be that one or more of the experts disagree but still provide constructive criticism or alternative viewpoints. furthermore, the question itself might be oversimplified, as getting into finance with a law degree could have various nuances and paths, not just a simple yes or no answer. thus, it can be argued that this scenario presents only two extremes when more exist, which is a false dilemma fallacy (or, if you consider the question itself oversimplified, then it's a straw man fallacy).",False
69,"POST: I have a JD, an MBA, and an MSF so I am pretty well versed in the skill sets.",nothing,"the answer is 'answer: circular reasoning'. this is because all three experts are using their expertise (jd, mba, msf) as evidence that they are knowledgeable about the task at hand, which is classifying something. however, their expertise is the very thing being discussed and questioned in the scenario. by using it to justify their ability to perform the task, they are essentially saying ""i know this because i am an expert"" which is a circular argument.",False
70,What about a JD would make you think you could do finance?,nothing,"the reasoning described does not necessarily constitute a fallacy. however, if one were to analyze it, it could be argued that it is an example of circular reasoning, since the answer to the question depends on the assumption that being a jd qualifies someone for doing finance (and vice versa). here's how:

* step 1: a jd (juris doctor, a law degree) is considered as a legal expert.
* step 2: to be good at finance, one needs to be an expert in certain areas, like economics or business law.
* step 3: since a jd has knowledge of law and business, they can do finance.
* step 4: a jd can do finance because they are already a finance expert (since the conclusion is based on the premise that being a jd means someone is a finance expert).

however, the reasoning as presented does not explicitly state the premise and conclusion in a circular fashion, so it may be considered more of a questionable argument structure rather than a fallacy. the answer would then be: 'answer: potentially circular reasoning'.",False
71,It is a pretty in depth math program.,nothing,"answer: fallacy of ambiguity
explanation: the statement presents a scenario where it is unclear who these experts are, what the classification task is, and how they would reach an agreement. the phrase ""imagine three different experts"" does not provide enough context for the reader to understand the scenario, leading to ambiguity and confusion in the argument.",False
72,There are some advanced math skills needed that are covered nowhere in undergrad or a JD unless you were also a finance major for BS.,nothing,answer: appeal to authority (without evidence of the authority's expertise on the specific subject),False
73,This is law school arrogance at its finest.,ad hominem,"answer: nothing (or ""no fallacy"")

explanation: while this statement seems somewhat condescending, it doesn't involve any specific logical fallacies as described in the given examples. it simply states an observation or opinion about a group of people, without using a fallacious argument structure. the statement can be interpreted as critical or dismissive, but it does not contain a faulty reasoning pattern.",False
74,Why not a brain surgeon?,ad hominem,"answer: appeal to authority (in this case, the experts) without specifying that they are actual authorities on the specific topic in question. the reasoning is that just because someone is an expert does not necessarily mean they have expertise in classifying fallacies in a specific way, especially if the method described involves multiple steps and potential for misunderstanding or misinterpretation. a brain surgeon may be an expert in their field but may not have any expertise or knowledge on fallacy classification methods using this particular scenario.",False
75,The sea-ice loss is President Vladimir Putin' s gain.,nothing,answer: false cause,False
76,"Already the largest country on the planet, Russia stands to gain access to shipping routes and energy reserves, and a strategic military advantage from the opening of the Arctic.",nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
77,"Along the Russian coastline, which makes up more than half the Arctic total, winds and currents push old ice away from potential shipping lanes and prevent the build-up of thicker, multi-year ice that would leave other parts of the Arctic impassable for longer periods.",nothing,answer: nothing,True

79,Brandon: We should have tastier lunches!,nothing,'answer: appeal to emotion',False
80,Jaylen:,nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
81,Don't listen to him!,ad hominem,"the statement doesn't explicitly describe a fallacy, but it can be analyzed as an example of 'groupthink'. this is a type of cognitive bias where people in a group make irrational or dysfunctional decisions mainly due to their desire for conformity. in this case, the experts might end up agreeing due to a need to avoid conflict or maintain group harmony rather than critically evaluating the issue at hand. however, since it doesn't follow the structure of describing one step of thinking, it is 'answer: nothing'.",False
82,He's a terrible person!,ad hominem,"answer: nothing. the given statement does not contain any indication of a fallacy as it is presented in this context. it merely expresses an opinion about someone, which in itself is neither right nor wrong and doesn't follow a specific fallacy pattern described in the provided examples.",False
83,I saw him trip another student and steal his lunch money!,ad hominem,'answer: guilt by association',False
84,TITLE: Sound familiar?,nothing,"answer: answer: circular reasoning. the reasoning here is that all experts must come to a final agreement, but if they do not agree at any point, one of them leaves. this creates a circle where the agreement is a condition for reaching an agreement.",False
85,POST: ok but can I just say - no his doesn't sound familiar.,nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
86,"The left is asking for expanding background checks, closing the gun show loop hole, maybe registering firearms and creating a system that addresses or catches strawman purchases.",nothing,answer: answer: nothing (this statement does not present a clear fallacy as described in the given context. it's a description of potential policy proposals regarding gun control.),True
87,We don't need to play this strawman argument game.,nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
88,"And we don't need to do the""slippery slope"" thing either.",nothing,"answer: answer: fallacy of majority

explanation: the reasoning here is that since all experts agree and continue agreeing, they must be correct, and there can be no disagreement. however, this assumes that a simple majority or consensus among the group is enough to prove the truth of an argument, which is not always the case. it's possible that one (or more) expert(s) may be incorrect, even if others agree with them. therefore, it is a fallacy where the conclusion is based on the number of people who agree rather than on the validity and strength of evidence.",False
89,Reasonable regulations doesn't lead to the fed keeping lists and someday coming after all gun owners to suppress the working class.,nothing,answer: nothing (this statement does not present a fallacy as described in the examples provided.),True
90,"Several years ago, a group of 10 psychologists started a psychology training program.",causal oversimplification,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents only one option (the psychology training program) as the solution, when in reality there may be multiple ways to gain psychology training. therefore, it is a fallacy where only two choices are presented yet more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes.",False
91,"Each of those psychologists is efficient, effective, and highly-regarded.",causal oversimplification,"answer: appeal to unquestionable authority (or bandwagon fallacy)
explanation: the argument here relies on the consensus or agreement among a group (the experts) as evidence for its validity, rather than providing independent reasoning or evidence. this is fallacious because it does not guarantee that the conclusion is true just because many people believe it to be so. the consensus of experts may be based on incorrect assumptions, biases, or insufficient data, and there is no requirement for independent verification. this argument is also a form of the bandwagon fallacy, which is using the popularity or prevalence of an idea to make it appear true, regardless of its actual merit.",False
92,"Their training program must be efficient, effective, and highly-regarded.",causal oversimplification,answer: circular reasoning,False
93,"efficient, effective, and highly-regarded.",false analogy,answer: nothing. the given scenario is not a fallacy. it is a hypothetical description of a process that may or may not result in the experts reaching an agreement. the reasoning steps and the decision-making structure are not indicative of any specific logical fallacies.,False
94,"I lost my phone in the living room, so it will always be in the living room when it is lost.",false causality,answer: fallacy of undistributed middle (or fallacy of composition),False
95,TITLE: Bar in Thurles in trouble over ad featuring Jesus with a pint.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma (or maybe equivocation, depending on how you interpret the statement)

explanation: the statement seems to present two choices: either the bar is in trouble or it isn't. however, there could be other possible outcomes like public backlash, legal action, negative press, etc., that are not included in this binary choice. additionally, the term ""trouble"" may have a broader interpretation than just legal or financial problems, but the statement does not make clear what specific kind of trouble is meant. therefore, it appears to be a fallacy of false dilemma due to oversimplifying the issue into two extreme possibilities when more nuanced choices exist, and potentially equivocation if ""trouble"" means something different than what the reader assumes it to mean.",False
96,Christians are slowly becoming bigger snowflakes than Muslims.,nothing,"answer: nothing. this statement is not necessarily a fallacy, but rather an opinion or statement of comparison between two groups. however, if the intention is to use this statement as an argument for a broader conclusion without providing supporting evidence or reasoning, it could potentially be considered an example of appeal to bias (using one's personal biases or prejudices to support an argument) or hasty generalization (drawing conclusions based on limited or unrepresentative data). but in the given context and with the specified constraints, this statement is not a fallacy.",True
97,POST:,nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
98,So was the bar burned by a mob and the owner killed?,hasty generalization,"answer: false dilemma (the statement presents only two outcomes - the bar being burned by a mob or not, but there are other possibilities such as arson, accidental fire, etc.)",False

100,TITLE: Now We Know Who Sold the Bottom at $6k And Tried To Crash Bitcoin - Spoiler alert: it was Mt.Gox trustee POST: can anyone explain the part where it says he tried to crash the market at 6k?....,nothing,answer: nothing (this statement does not provide a clear argument that can be classified as a fallacy as described in the examples provided. the statement is asking a question and is not making an argument with premises and a conclusion.),True
101,i dont get the reasoning behind this?,nothing,"the reasoning behind this scenario seems to describe a hypothetical consensus-building process where experts agree upon a final conclusion. however, since no actual argument or conclusion is provided for analysis, it cannot be classified as a fallacy. therefore, the answer would be 'answer: nothing'.",True
102,"POST: If you sell at high prices, that makes sense, doesn't it?",nothing,answer: answer: fallacy of hasty generalization. the reasoning is a jump from a single example (selling at high prices) to making a universal claim (that this always makes sense). it does not take into account other factors or exceptions that may exist.,False
103,"If you sell at bottom, you're either panicking or trying to crash the price of the asset you're selling.",false dilemma,"answer: fallacy of false cause
explanation: the statement suggests that if someone sells an asset at a low price, it is because they are either panicking or trying to crash the market. however, this assumes that there is a causal relationship between selling an asset at a low price and the intention behind the sale, which may not necessarily be true. there could be other reasons for the sale unrelated to these suggested in the statement.",False
104,"So if he sold big amounts at 6k, he tried to bring the price even lower and cause a total sell off.",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
105,That is my logic.,nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
106,TITLE: Transgender brain scans promised as study shows structural differences in people with gender dysphoria POST:,nothing,"'answer: fallacy of equivocation'

explanation: the reasoning is based on the ambiguous term ""transgender"" which can refer to individuals who identify as a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth, and individuals with gender dysphoria, a psychological condition characterized by distress due to the incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned sex. the study only examines structural differences in people with gender dysphoria, not all transgender individuals. therefore, it is a fallacy where an ambiguous term is used to make an argument misleading.",False

111,"Next week he will be in Paris, a city terrorized yet again by mass murderers, for a summit with other world leaders on climate change, not terrorism.",nothing,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents the idea that discussing terrorism or climate change is exclusive; the speaker discusses only the latter despite it being relevant to both. a more comprehensive approach would consider both issues as interconnected.",False
112,What precisely makes these world leaders so convinced that climate change is a more urgent and massive threat than the incessant rampages of Islamist violence?,appeal to anger,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, fear)",False
113,"It can not be what is happening to world temperatures, because they have gone up only very slowly, less than half as fast as the scientific consensus predicted in 1990 when the global-warming scare began in earnest.",nothing,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents two extremes (the rate at which world temperatures are rising is either exactly as fast as predicted or slower) without acknowledging that the rate could be somewhere between these two extremes, which is what actually happens in reality.",False
114,"These are unidentified people, and after the bomb goes off, they're blown to bits because they are suicidal individuals who think they're going to go to paradise if they perpetrate such an act and lose their life in doing it.",nothing,"answer: appeal to motivation (also known as argumentum ad motiva)
explanation: the reasoning behind this conclusion relies on the motivation of the suicide bombers rather than the facts or evidence about them, which is a fallacy. in this case, the argument assumes that because these individuals are suicidal and believe they will go to paradise after committing their act, it is therefore true that they were blown to bits by a bomb. however, there may be many other factors (such as the explosion itself or other circumstances) that led to their deaths, and the argument does not provide enough evidence to support its conclusion based solely on the motivation of the individuals.",False
115,"We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken.",nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
116,"But we're not going to simply kill some people to say,""Oh, look, we got even.''
",nothing,"answer: false dilemma
explanation: the statement presents a situation where it is implied that the only two options are either ""we do something"" or ""we do nothing"". however, there are more options available such as engaging in peaceful discussions, negotiating, or seeking mediation. therefore, the speaker is presenting a false choice of only two extremes (action versus inaction) when other reasonable options exist.",True
117,smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you,circular reasoning,"answer: hasty generalization
explanation: the argument assumes that all cigarettes can and will kill everyone who smokes them, but it does not provide evidence to support this claim. it is possible for some people to smoke cigarettes without being harmed, just as it is possible for a small number of people to consume alcohol or drive cars without getting into accidents. the argument oversimplifies the issue by implying that every cigarette is deadly for everyone who smokes them, which is not supported by evidence or reason.",False

123,"Killing for food is 100% acceptable and morally right, and the suffering of the animals involved is fucking irrelevant.",appeal to nature,answer: nothing (there is no explicit fallacy in this statement as it does not present an argument or conclusion with a premise that can be challenged as a fallacy),False
124,Lions don't give a fuck about the screams of a wildebeest as they disembowel it for a dinner.,appeal to nature,"answer: equivocation

explanation: the word ""fuck"" is used in two different senses. first, in its common slang meaning as an expression of strong emotion or indifference (as shown in the context). second, in its sexual connotation which has no place in this context. by using a term with multiple meanings without clarifying, the argument becomes misleading and falls into the fallacy of equivocation.",False
125,"There is nothing, save for your ego, that gives you a reason to act or feel any different.",appeal to nature,"answer: false absolute

explanation: the statement claims that there is nothing beyond the speaker's ego influencing their actions or feelings. however, this is not necessarily true because people can be motivated by various factors like emotions, experiences, beliefs, and relationships outside of themselves. in essence, the statement presents an absolute claim without enough evidence to support it.",False

130,"You should drive on the right side of the road because that is what the law says, and the law is the law.",circular reasoning,"answer: fallacy of authority (appeal to legitimacy)
explanation: the reasoning relies on the ""law"" as an alleged authority to support its conclusion that one should drive on the right side of the road. however, the law is not an expert or authority on driving practices, but rather a set of rules created by society. the statement does not provide evidence from actual experts or authorities on traffic safety to justify the claim.",False

144,"Every sunrise, the rooster makes a sound.",false causality,"'answer: hasty generalization'
explanation: while it is true that every sunrise observed in the past might have involved a rooster making a sound, there is no evidence to suggest that it is always the case (for example, it may not be possible to hear the sound of a rooster due to distance or other environmental factors). therefore, this statement infers that all instances share this characteristic based on limited evidence, which is fallacious.",False

146,I passed my math test after going out to the movies the night before.,false causality,"'answer: false cause'

explanation: the idea that going to the movies caused passing the math test is not supported by any evidence or reason, as there are many factors that could have contributed to passing the test, such as studying or reviewing material earlier, understanding the subject matter, or even luck. therefore, it is a fallacy where cause and effect are incorrectly connected, assuming that one event directly caused another without sufficient evidence or reasoning.",False
147,I should go to the movies the night before every math test!,false causality,"the given statement does not describe a specific fallacy. it is a suggestion or hypothesis, not a logical fallacy. however, if we were to analyze it for potential fallacies, here's an example of how it could be broken down:

1. statement: i should go to the movies the night before every math test!
2. explanation: the argument suggests that going to the movies helps in performing better on math tests.
3. reasoning: this is a potential example of 'causal fallacy' or 'post hoc ergo propter hoc,' as the statement assumes that because one action (going to the movies) follows another action (taking a math test), it must be the cause of the result. in reality, many factors could influence the outcome of the test.",False

153,End of argument.,appeal to nature,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation: the process described is based on the agreement of all experts, which means that if any one expert leaves, there will be no agreement reached. however, the reason for leaving is that they realized they were wrong at some point. this implies that their initial reasoning was flawed and they had to correct it before coming to a conclusion. thus, their final decision is based on the premise that all experts must come to an agreement, which in turn relies on the very same agreement being reached (a circular argument).",False

158,It broke my heart.,nothing,"the provided statement does not describe a specific fallacy, but rather expresses an emotional response (appeal to emotion). however, if we were to imagine this scenario and consider the process as steps in an argument, it could be considered a form of groupthink, where conformity pressure within the group results in unquestioned or poor decision-making. if the experts are influenced by each other's opinions without critically evaluating their own thoughts, they may come to a conclusion that is not based on evidence or reason, but rather on social pressure (groupthink).

162,Studies show that abortions occur just as frequently in nations where it is legal as nations where it is not.,nothing,"answer: false cause fallacy

explanation: the claim suggests that the frequency of abortions is caused by whether or not it is legal, when in fact other factors such as socio-economic status, access to healthcare, cultural beliefs, and laws regulating contraceptives may play a larger role. in this scenario, the experts would start with their initial assumption (abortion frequency is determined by legality) and share it with the group. upon further discussion, they would realize that there are many other factors at play, causing them to leave as they come to the conclusion that the initial assumption was incorrect.",False

165,TITLE: So Pointy!,nothing,"'answer: circular reasoning'

explanation: in this scenario, the experts are reaching a final agreement. however, the method they use for coming to an agreement involves them sharing their individual thoughts and continuing only if they agree with each other. this creates a cycle where the agreement is based on the opinions of the group, which are then used to justify their own opinion. in essence, they are using their own conclusion as evidence for that same conclusion, resulting in circular reasoning.",False

214,Once you start gambling you find it hard to stop.,slippery slope,"'answer: circular reasoning'

218,"We may not be able to stop it, but we' d better get ready to adapt to it.",false dilemma,"the statement seems to describe a thought experiment rather than an argument, and hence it does not appear to contain a fallacy as traditionally defined (i.e., an incorrect or misleading reasoning in an argument). however, if we interpret the statement as an informal argument that the experts will eventually come to agreement because they are forced to adapt to the process, then it could be considered a fallacy of assumption (or presupposition), where the validity of the premise is assumed without evidence or justification.

in this case, the assumption is that the experts will adapt to the process, which leads them to come to an agreement, but this assumption may not necessarily hold true in every situation. in other words, there's no guarantee that the experts will adapt to the process and reach a final agreement, so basing the argument on this assumption could be fallacious.

explanation: the experts must come to a final agreement. this implies that they will keep discussing and debating until an agreement is reached, which means that the discussion continues until everyone agrees (i.e., there is a consensus). however, reaching a consensus does not necessarily mean that their decision is correct or based on factual evidence. instead, it suggests that they came to an agreement through discussion and persuasion, which creates circular reasoning: the conclusion (agreement) depends on the premises (discussion and persuasion), but the premises depend on the conclusion (agreement). in this case, the argument relies on reaching an agreement as evidence of its validity, creating a circle in the reasoning.",False

explanation: the statement presents a choice between two options (the experts agreeing or leaving) when more choices actually exist (continuing to discuss and potentially changing each other's minds, consulting additional experts, etc.). the implication is that the only acceptable outcome is for all experts to come to a final agreement, which is a fallacy of false dilemma.",False
233,I think what's cooler about Post Malone and other wildly successful people is they are doing what they love doing.,nothing,"the statement provided does not seem to contain a fallacy in the described scenario, as it simply states an observation about post malone and others. however, if we were to analyze the argument being made in a broader context, one could argue that it might be an example of 'appeal to popularity' or 'bandwagon appeal', where the success or popularity of these individuals is used to imply their actions are valid or desirable. but in this specific scenario as described, there isn't enough information to make that determination, so the answer would be: 'answer: nothing'.",True
234,That's real success.,nothing,"answer: answer: fallacy of many questions
explanation: the situation is designed in a way that it forces all experts to agree on the final answer, which may not necessarily be correct. if any expert disagrees at any point, they are forced to leave the group and stop participating, making it impossible for them to share their thoughts or reasoning with the rest of the group. this can lead to a situation where incorrect or incomplete information is being considered as the final agreement due to lack of dissenting opinions. the fact that all experts must come to a final agreement is a fallacy of many questions, since it assumes that a single correct answer exists and that it can be reached through this method.",False

245,TITLE: What would people think about preventing people from switching out from a pilot seat?,nothing,"the given statement doesn't explicitly describe an argument with premises and conclusion, but it seems to follow the structure of a hypothetical scenario. in this case, i will analyze it as if it were an argument.

explanation: this scenario describes a process where experts share their thoughts step by step in order to come to an agreement. it does not specify that only two choices are presented, or that there is a fallacy of circular reasoning, so those fallacies do not seem applicable. the statement also does not rely on emotions or authority as evidence.

however, the scenario appears to involve a fallacy called 'group think'. group think happens when a group makes faulty decisions due to unquestioned assumptions and a pressure to conform to consensus without adequately considering alternative viewpoints or dissenting opinions. in this case, experts share thoughts with each other and are encouraged to leave if they realize their thinking is wrong. this creates an environment where the group may fail to consider alternative viewpoints and reach a potentially incorrect conclusion.

answer: answer: group think",False
246,i.e. to a gunner position; you'd still be able to bail.,nothing,"answer: fallacy of equivocation. the reasoning equates ""a final agreement"" with an ""agreement after discussing and debating"", but those two concepts are not the same.",False
247,POST:,nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
248,This is a ridiculous post and this mechanic will never be changed.,appeal to tradition,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents only one way of reaching an agreement (all experts sharing thoughts in sequence, leaving if they realize they're wrong) while ignoring other possible methods for reaching a final agreement (such as discussion, collaboration, or voting). thus, it limits the spectrum of possible choices to just the proposed method.",False
249,Seat switching has always been a BF mechanic.,appeal to tradition,"answer: answer: circular reasoning

explanation: the reasoning presented is that since seat switching has always been a part of the battlefield (bf) mechanics, it must be correct for the experts to continue using this method in their classification process. however, the argument relies on the premise that seat switching is a valid method, which is being used as evidence to support its own validity. this creates a circular reasoning where the conclusion (seat switching is valid) supports the premise (seat switching has always been used), but the premise in turn supports the conclusion.",False

253,POST:,nothing,"answer: answer: false dilemma (or circular reasoning if it is assumed that all experts must agree at the end)

explanation: the statement presents only one method of reaching a final agreement, and implies that any other method would not result in an agreement. however, there are many ways to reach an agreement besides the one presented. therefore, it is a false dilemma fallacy. if it is assumed that all experts must agree at the end, then the reasoning becomes circular, as the final agreement is used as evidence for the requirement of an agreement.",False
254,Social media is the worst.,hasty generalization,"answer: answer: false dilemma
explanation: the statement presents social media as either ""the worst"" or some other hypothetical option. however, there may be varying degrees of good and bad aspects associated with social media, making it a spectrum rather than a binary choice (either the best or the worst).",False

257,"I understand studios force some actors to be active there, but if it's the difference between leading a happy, healthy life or getting a movie role, it really should be an easy decision.",nothing,"'answer: appeal to emotion'
explanation: the argument is trying to make its point by appealing to the emotions of the reader rather than providing substantial evidence in favor of the claim. it suggests that it would be an easy decision for actors to stay in a studio, despite being forced, if it means they can lead a happy and healthy life or get a movie role. however, this is not a universally true statement as factors such as personal values, career aspirations, and the nature of the studio could all influence the decision differently for each individual.",False
258,"POST: Really, the worst?",nothing,"answer: false dilemma. the scenario suggests that there are only two possible outcomes: either all experts come to a final agreement or they realize they're wrong and leave. however, it is possible for them to continue discussing and reach an understanding without necessarily agreeing on everything or realizing they're completely wrong. thus, the problem is oversimplified by presenting only two extreme possibilities as if they are the only options available.",False

261,Edit: I feel like I need to clarify that I'm not trying to deny what Pete is going through.,nothing,"answer: answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents a scenario where all experts must come to an agreement, but this is not necessary for the classification task as described. there are multiple ways to classify fallacies and not all experts may need to agree on every step of their thinking. therefore, it is a false dilemma because only two choices (agreement or disagreement) are presented when there exist other possibilities.",False

274,Governments have shown time and time again that they are more than happy to censor and abuse their peoples.,slippery slope,"answer: answer: false dilemma
explanation: the statement presents two extremes (governments censoring and abusing their people) as if they are the only possible outcomes, when in reality there is a spectrum of possibilities between these two extremes. for example, a government might have some censorship laws but not abuse its citizens, or it might not have any censorship laws at all. the statement oversimplifies the complex issue of government behavior into a false dichotomy.",False

277,That means it must be really good!,ad populum,"'answer: circular reasoning'

explanation: the process described in the statement assumes that all experts will reach a final agreement, but the method for reaching this agreement is based on each expert's individual thinking and sharing their steps with others. if they continue to share steps and never come to a disagreement, then they have effectively reached an agreement by not disagreeing, which is circular reasoning: the conclusion is used as evidence for the conclusion.",False
278,"If we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment, then eventually the government will ban all cars; therefore, we should not ban Hummers.""",slippery slope,"'answer: false dilemma'

explanation: the argument presents only two extreme possibilities - banning hummers and banning all cars. however, there is a spectrum of possible choices that exist between these two extremes, such as implementing stricter emission standards for vehicles or encouraging the use of more fuel-efficient alternatives without an outright ban on any specific type of vehicle. the argument oversimplifies the issue by presenting only two options and ignoring other possibilities.",False

explanation: the reasoning here presents only one way of reaching a final agreement, which is by the experts writing down steps of their thinking and then sharing them with the group. however, there might be other ways to reach an agreement, such as having open discussions or debates among the experts. therefore, it is a fallacy where only two choices are presented yet more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes.",False

explanation: the statement implies that there are only two experts, those who agree with ca and those who don’t (those left behind). however, it could be possible for experts to disagree on certain steps of the thinking process but still reach an agreement at a later step. therefore, more than just the two possibilities presented in the statement exist.",False
296,Keep being a beacon of hope CA and I'm sure other states will follow.,appeal to ridicule,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement implies that if california continues to be a ""beacon of hope"", other states will follow. however, it is fallacious to suggest that there are only two possible outcomes - either other states follow or they do not. there may be many intermediate possibilities such as some states following, some states not following, or no clear trend emerging at all.",False

299,The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.,causal oversimplification,"'answer: false cause'
explanation: the statement suggests that the current economic crisis is a result of the policies of the last eight years and washington's unwillingness to tackle tough problems for decades, implying a direct causal relationship between the two. however, it is possible that there are other factors contributing to the crisis, making this a case of false cause fallacy.",False
300,And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.,appeal to fear,"answer: fallacy of circular reasoning. the argument relies on the premise that the current policies are ""failed"" and the conclusion is that we should not adopt them again, but this conclusion implies that the current policies are indeed ""failed"", which was the initial assumption used to support the conclusion, creating a circular argument where no new information is shared.",False
301,TITLE: Abstinence vs.,nothing,"answer: answer: false dilemma (or appeal to extremes)

explanation: the statement presents a dichotomy between abstinence and the unspecified ""other"" without offering any other options or discussing the spectrum of possible choices that exist between these two extremes. by implying that one must either entirely abstain or engage in sexual activity, it ignores the various degrees and types of sexual behavior that people can choose from.",False
302,"those who chose to have sex, a dilemma I'd like to understand!",nothing,"'answer: false dilemma'

explanation: the statement presents a situation (having sex) as if it were a binary choice when in fact there may be more options. this is a fallacy of false dilemma because it oversimplifies the issue by presenting only two extreme positions, whereas other possibilities might exist or be preferable.",False

325,We're treading water.,appeal to anger,"the reasoning provided does not describe a specific fallacy. it describes a hypothetical situation where experts are trying to reach an agreement through a process of iterative thinking and elimination, but there is no mention of any logical fallacy being committed in the process. therefore, 'answer: nothing'.",False
326,We have families that are hurting.,appeal to anger,"'answer: appeal to emotion'
explanation: the statement tries to evoke an emotional response in the reader (in this case, feeling for families who are hurting) as a way to support its claim. however, this type of argument lacks evidence or rational reasoning and is therefore considered a fallacy known as ""appeal to emotion"".",False
327,We have people who are unemployed.,appeal to anger,"answer: false dilemma. the statement presents only two steps (experts reaching an agreement) while ignoring other possible scenarios, such as the experts disagreeing and needing more time or resources to come to an agreement, or a situation where one expert leaves due to realizing they were wrong.",False
328,We have people with no property.,appeal to anger,answer: fallacy of irrelevance. the fact that people have no property does not imply anything about their ability to make logical decisions or come to a final agreement.,False

330,"Their solution to the inner city is more -- excuse the expression but it's true,""socialism.""",guilt by association,"the statement does not contain a clear argument with premises and conclusions, so it is not possible to classify it as a fallacy. however, if we interpret ""their solution to the inner city is more -- excuse the expression but it’s true,'socialism'"" as an attempt to present an opinion as a fact (an appeal to authority that is not actually an authority on the matter), then the answer could be: 'answer: appeal to (false) authority'. but this interpretation is somewhat strained, given the informal nature of the statement. so, in this case, the answer would be: 'answer: nothing'.",False
331,"Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, and Jimi Hendrix were rock stars who died young.",hasty generalization,"answer: nothing (or ""no fallacy detected"" if you prefer)

explanation: the statement simply presents a series of facts without any attempt to use them as evidence for a claim or draw a conclusion that is not inherent in the given information. there is no logical fallacy present in this statement.",False
332,"Therefore, if you become a rock star, don't expect to live a long life.",hasty generalization,"answer: false cause
explanation: the premise suggests that becoming a rock star leads to a shortened lifespan, but this is not necessarily true. there are many factors that can contribute to the length of a person's life, and being a rock star is just one factor. it is a fallacy because it assumes a cause-and-effect relationship where one does not exist. the premise presents becoming a rock star as the cause for a shorter lifespan, but this is not supported by evidence or reason.",False

338,Will you tell us why you think you are?,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation: the process of the experts coming to a final agreement relies on their agreement as evidence for the validity of their conclusions, which is a circular argument. each expert's reasoning is based on the group's agreement, and the group's agreement is based on each expert's individual reasoning. therefore, they are relying on their own conclusion (the agreement) to support the premise (individual reasoning), creating a closed loop of reasoning with no new information shared among the experts.",False
339,RONALD REAGAN: Yes.,nothing,"answer: answer: false dilemma (or circular reasoning if it is assumed that ronald reagan implies that all experts must agree with him)
explanation: the statement presents a scenario where there are multiple experts who disagree and they need to come to an agreement. however, the method of reaching an agreement presented in the scenario only allows for one expert to leave at each step when they realize they're wrong, which implies that all experts must eventually agree with ronald reagan (or the first expert) since they cannot all be wrong. this creates a false dilemma as there are more possible solutions than just the two presented in the statement. additionally, if it is assumed that ronald reagan implies that all experts must agree with him, then the reasoning would be circular since his conclusion is based on the premise that all experts must agree with him.",False

342,TITLE: The bible is not Clear POST:,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation: the experts in this scenario are asked to come to a final agreement about the clarity of the bible. they do so by each writing down one step of their thinking, sharing it with the group, then going on to the next step. however, if any expert realizes they're wrong at any point, they leave. the problem is that reaching an agreement in this process relies on the initial assumption (the bible is not clear), which is being used as evidence for the conclusion (they all come to an agreement). this creates a circular argument where the proposition is supported by the premises, which are supported by the proposition, creating no useful information being shared.",False

345,"<URL>
",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

here's the explanation: the experts are asked to agree on an answer, and each expert shares one step of their thinking. if any expert realizes they are wrong at any point, they leave. this process implies that if all experts reach an agreement, it must be correct because it was arrived at through consensus among the experts. however, consensus does not necessarily equate to truth or validity in reasoning. the conclusion (that the answer is correct) is based on the premise (all experts agree), which is then used as evidence for the conclusion itself. this creates a circular argument where no new information is being shared, making it difficult to determine if the conclusion is actually valid.",False

explanation: the statement presents only one method (sharing thoughts in a sequential manner) while other methods are not considered, such as group discussions or individual analysis and then sharing the conclusions. this is a fallacy of false dilemma because it suggests that there are only two options (one method or the other), whereas more methods exist or could be considered.",False

explanation: the statement presents two options (animals are food or they aren't) and implies that only one is correct, when in fact, there are other possibilities, such as animals being raised and killed for consumption while also being treated humanely and respectfully. this creates a fallacy of false dilemma by ignoring the existence of alternative viewpoints or options between the presented extremes.",False

explanation: reducing the defense budget may have caused some layoffs in the defense industry, but it is not certain that it was the sole or primary cause for these layoffs and it does not necessarily follow that other industries would not be affected. also, it is not clear that the experts would come to a final agreement in this scenario since they may interpret the information differently and have varying degrees of confidence in their assumptions about the causal relationship between defense spending and employment.",False

364,Our military is the strongest military in the world.,appeal to positive emotion,"answer: circular reasoning. the argument relies on the premise that the military being the strongest implies it must be true, yet the truth of it being the strongest is what is being argued in the first place. no independent evidence or reason is provided to support this claim.",False
365,"It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been.",appeal to positive emotion,"the reasoning provided does not seem to follow a clear pattern of a logical fallacy. it describes a hypothetical scenario where three experts classify something and agree on a final answer. there are no steps or conclusions that indicate a fallacious argument.

however, if we were to interpret the statement as a claim about an expert's opinion, it could be argued that it is an example of circular reasoning: 'the answer must be correct because the experts are the strongest, best prepared, and best equipped.' in this case, the premise (the expertise of the experts) is used to support the conclusion (their final agreement). but, in reality, their expertise should already justify their ability to reach a correct conclusion without needing to use that same expertise as evidence.

so, while not exactly fitting the format described in the question, it could be argued that the reasoning provided contains circular reasoning.

explanation: the statement suggests that there are only two possible explanations for the test results being wrong: the client was malingering (faking symptoms) or the examiner bungled the test administration. however, this overlooks other possibilities such as the test itself being flawed, errors in scoring, or other external factors influencing the results. therefore, it is a fallacy where only two choices are presented yet more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes.",True

explanation: the statement suggests that because many people believe or said that trump's plan would not work, the fact that it now seems to be working validates those opinions. however, the belief in the failure of trump's plan is irrelevant to whether it actually works or not. therefore, the argument relies on the popular opinion to support its claim rather than presenting evidence for its own merit, making it a fallacy known as appeal to popularity or bandwagon fallacy.",False

explanation: the claim is made that because the individual implemented larger deficits during his tenure, he was wrong. however, it does not follow logically that if something is true (being right in this case), then a completely different action (implementing large deficits) would negate that truth. in other words, just because one event happens after another does not mean it is causally related to the first event.",False

explanation: the process is set up so that each expert must rely on the agreement of others in order to move forward, but in doing so they are relying on the premise (that all experts will come to a final agreement) to support their own conclusion (to reach a final agreement). therefore, the reasoning is circular and no useful information or evidence is being shared.",False
435,Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.,appeal to (false) authority,"the reasoning provided does not necessarily constitute a fallacy, but it can be argued as an example of an informal logical fallacy known as 'bandwagon appeal' or 'argumentum ad populum'. this fallacy occurs when an argument is considered to be correct because many people believe it to be true. in this case, the statement implies that since even a political group (republican platform) has criticized mr. ford and the administration's foreign policy, it makes their argument more valid or accepted by others. however, the truth or falsity of an argument should not depend on its popularity or how many people believe it.

the reasoning provided does not strictly follow the rules for a fallacy as described in the given examples (one step of thinking, shared with the group, etc.), so the answer would be 'answer: nothing'. but if we were to consider this an example of bandwagon appeal, the answer would be 'answer: bandwagon appeal'.",False

explanation: the statement does not present any argument that falls under a specific fallacy. it simply expresses an agreement between the speaker and the republican platform without providing any reasoning or evidence for it. the reasoning or thought process in this case is missing because it is assumed that the fact of agreeing with the republican platform is enough to convince the audience, which is not logically valid.",True

explanation: in this case, the argument relies on miller's status as an expert because he taught the arguer's older brother, but it is unclear if miller actually has expertise relevant to the discussion at hand. additionally, there is no indication of whether or not the arguer's older brother was a good student, which could affect miller's credibility in this context.",False

explanation: the statement presents only two choices (living with or without recreational drugs) while in reality there are more options. for example, a person can choose not to use recreational drugs but still enjoy other forms of recreation. therefore, the statement presents a binary choice where more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes.",False
445,"POST: Ideal, perhaps for some.",nothing,"answer: answer: false dilemma (or circular reasoning if it's assumed that the experts must all agree in order to reach a final agreement)

explanation: the statement suggests that there are only two possibilities: either everyone involved will eventually come to an agreement or they will realize they're wrong and leave. however, it is possible for more than two outcomes to occur in this scenario. for example, one expert might believe that the others are wrong but choose not to leave because they feel obligated to stay and continue discussing. or, the experts may never reach a final agreement due to differences in opinion that cannot be resolved. therefore, it's a fallacy of false dilemma.

explanation: in this scenario, only three types of laws are mentioned (against theft, murder, and slavery). however, there exist numerous other laws regulating various aspects of human behavior, such as traffic laws, zoning regulations, environmental protection laws, etc. thus, the statement presents a false dilemma by implying that there are only three categories of laws, when in reality there is a wide spectrum of possible laws.",False

473,So he's saying liberals are better educated than conservatives.,equivocation,"the statement does not directly present a fallacy, but it could be considered as an example of an ""appeal to authority"" or ""hasty generalization."" here is the reasoning step by step:

1. the speaker presents the claim that liberals are better educated than conservatives.
2. the speaker implies that since these experts are participating in this thought experiment, they are likely liberal or well-educated individuals.
3. by assuming the experts to be liberal or well-educated, the speaker infers that their classification results will support the claim. however, this reasoning is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that some experts may be conservative or less educated, and their input would still need to be considered.
4. the premise that all experts are liberal or well-educated is unfounded and oversimplifies the complexity of the population being classified.
5. if the thought experiment were carried out, it could result in disagreement among the experts, but the speaker's argument is based on the assumption that they will come to a final agreement, which is not guaranteed.
6. therefore, the statement can be seen as an example of hasty generalization or appeal to authority since it oversimplifies the population being classified and assumes consensus from experts without accounting for potential differences in political ideology and education levels.

explanation: in this scenario, the question presents only two options - healthy or unhealthy. however, many foods can exist on a spectrum of healthiness and it might be possible that certain foods are marketed as ""healthy"" but have hidden unhealthy components. therefore, the question is presenting a false dilemma by suggesting there are only two categories when in reality there may be more possibilities.",False

489,TITLE: There are now traffic cameras that can spot you using your phone while driving POST:,nothing,"'answer: false dilemma'

explanation: the statement presents a scenario where the only options seem to be either all experts agree or none of them do. however, there is a possibility that some may agree but others do not, and they would continue discussing until they reach an agreement without any expert leaving. therefore, it is a false dilemma as more than two possible outcomes exist in this scenario.",False

explanation: the statement suggests that there are only three experts participating in the classification, implying that they must all come to a final agreement without considering the possibility of more experts or alternative perspectives. this is a fallacy because it presents only two choices (the three experts agreeing or disagreeing) while ignoring other possibilities such as adding more experts or considering different viewpoints.",False

498,"Despite the addition of some healthy menu items, fast food is even more unhealthy for you than it was 30 years ago.",nothing,"answer: false cause fallacy

explanation (step by step):
1. the statement claims that the addition of some healthy menu items to fast food makes it more unhealthy than it was 30 years ago. this is a logical leap because adding healthier options does not necessarily mean the overall nutritional value of the food has worsened.
2. however, if we assume the statement as true for argument's sake, then the reasoning behind this claim would involve considering factors such as serving sizes, ingredients, preparation methods, and portion control over the past 30 years that might have contributed to the perceived increase in unhealthiness.
3. since there is no evidence presented or implied regarding these specific factors, the assumption that the addition of healthier options causes fast food to become more unhealthy lacks a reasonable explanation and is therefore a fallacy known as false cause (also called causal oversimplification).",False

503,Let's not forget Genetically Modified foods.,appeal to nature,"answer: fallacy of false cause
explanation: the reasoning in this statement is that just because different experts are doing a classification, they will all come to an agreement and if one realizes they are wrong, they leave. however, this does not mean that their agreement is based on the logic or evidence presented but rather on the process of elimination or some other factor irrelevant to the validity of the conclusion. the idea that their final agreement would be reached because each expert shares a step in their thinking is a false cause fallacy, as the final agreement is not necessarily caused by this shared step in reasoning.",False
504,They are not on our food chain.,appeal to nature,"the reasoning given does not constitute a fallacy, it is simply a description of a process. however, if we were to analyze this process further for potential logical fallacies, we could say that the experts may be assuming they will all arrive at the same conclusion based solely on their expertise (an appeal to authority), or that they may leave because of personal biases rather than rational disagreement (tu quoque). but these are not explicitly stated in the given scenario.

explanation: the statement suggests a causal relationship between pornography and various negative effects, but it does not provide sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this claim. it is possible that other factors could contribute to these outcomes, and correlation does not imply causation in this case. therefore, the argument is a fallacy of false cause, as it incorrectly assumes that one event causes another without sufficient evidence.",False

explanation: the statement suggests that watching more or more extreme porn leads to an increase in dopamine levels. however, this is not necessarily true as there are many factors that can influence dopamine levels and it is not a direct result of porn consumption. this fallacy occurs because the argument assumes a causal relationship between two things (porn consumption and increased dopamine levels) without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.",False

524,"We caused the problem in the first place, and it cost us 20 to 50 billion to bail them out.",nothing,"answer: false cause

explanation: the idea that we caused a problem and had to pay to fix it implies that there is a direct cause-and-effect relationship between our actions and the need for a bailout, which may not be the case. simply because an event followed another does not necessarily mean one caused the other. in this scenario, there could have been multiple factors contributing to the problem requiring a bailout, and it might not be accurate or fair to attribute the entire situation to our actions.",False

in this hypothetical scenario:

- the argument's structure is based on the premise that all experts will reach a final agreement.
- the process assumes that each step taken by an individual expert is valid, without verification or questioning by others.

explanation: the statement describes a process where experts attempt to reach an agreement, but if any expert realizes they are wrong at any point, they leave. this implies that disagreement indicates error and leaving is a form of admitting error. however, this reasoning assumes that all experts must agree for the conclusion (there is much turmoil towards the pharmaceutical industry) to be valid, which is circular since it uses the conclusion as part of the premise.",False

explanation: the process described relies on the agreement of all experts, which is used as evidence that the final answer is correct. however, if all experts agree, it does not necessarily mean that they are right, just that they all believe the same thing, which creates a circular argument with no useful information being shared. professionals in this field may or may not feel the same way about the field, but the statement does not provide enough context to make an accurate determination.",False

explanation: the process described in the statement assumes that the experts will arrive at a final agreement based on their individual steps of thinking and sharing them with the group. however, if they come to an agreement, it means that all of their individual steps must be consistent and agreeable with each other, which is circular reasoning because the conclusion (agreement) depends on the premises (individual steps), and those premises in turn depend on the conclusion.",False

1) the statement suggests that because medication for rare conditions doesn't recoup development costs for one example (the first step), it will never recoup the cost for all such medications (the next steps). however, this assumption does not hold true as there may be exceptions or variables that are not accounted for in this reasoning.
2) the conclusion drawn (medication for rare conditions don't get researched) is based on the premise that they never recoup development costs, which was shown to be a fallacy. therefore, it is a slippery slope fallacy because the argument assumes that what is true in one instance will always be true in all instances, without considering exceptions or variables.

explanation: in this scenario, the two options presented are either that the experts come to a final agreement or leave. however, there could be other possibilities such as continuing the discussion until all experts have shared their reasoning and then revisiting each step to ensure understanding and accuracy, or consulting additional resources for guidance. therefore, it is a fallacy where only two choices are presented yet more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes.",False

in this case, the argument assumes that all experts will follow the same process, reach the same conclusion, and not leave at any point, based solely on the description provided. in reality, it is possible for experts to have different opinions, to come to disagreements, or to even withdraw from a discussion if they realize their initial assumption was incorrect.

however, if we assume that the speakers are indeed experts in this context, then their argument can be viewed as an example of 'groupthink', a phenomenon where a group makes decisions or reaches consensus without critical evaluation due to social pressure and conformity. the assumption that all three experts will write down one step of their thinking, share it with the group, go on to the next step, etc., suggests a lack of independent thinking and critical analysis, as they are heavily influenced by the group's decision-making process.

explanation (step by step):
1. the statement mentions that three different experts are doing the classification and will come to a final agreement.
2. this suggests that if all experts agree on something, it must be correct or smart.
3. however, consensus is not always an indicator of intelligence, truth, or validity in arguments or ideas.
4. there can be biases, groupthink, or incorrect information shared among the experts that lead to a wrong conclusion.

explanation: the statement describes a process where experts agree by each taking turns and sharing one step of their thinking, but if any expert realizes they're wrong at any point then they leave. this process will eventually lead to an agreement because the remaining experts will all be in agreement at each step, creating a circular reasoning. each expert will have agreed with the previous expert, and the final conclusion is based on the same premises that were agreed upon in the earlier steps.",False

the scenario suggests a decision-making process where all experts start with different viewpoints and share their reasoning one step at a time. if any expert realizes they're wrong during the process, they leave. the ultimate goal is for the remaining experts to come to an agreement. this process assumes that if an expert leaves, their viewpoint is incorrect, which might not always be the case.

in this scenario, there seems to be a fallacy of consensus: the idea that because all or most people believe something, it must be true. the assumption here is that if all experts come to an agreement, their conclusion must be correct, regardless of whether each step of reasoning leading to that conclusion was sound. answer: fallacy of consensus.",False

explanation: the reasoning here is that the person starts by saying they are looking for a dog groomer experienced with anxious dogs, and then recommends a place called fetch which presumably has such a dog groomer because its name suggests it is a place where one can fetch an anxious dog. however, this is circular reasoning because the qualification of the dog groomer at fetch being experienced with anxious dogs comes from the very premise that the person was looking for such a dog groomer in the first place.",False

881,"Some do get boosted, some don't.",nothing,"the reasoning given does not necessarily constitute a fallacy, as it describes a hypothetical situation and not an argument with premises and conclusions. however, if we were to analyze this scenario as an argument, one possible fallacy could be 'appeal to consensus' (or appeal to popularity). in this case, the assumption is that if all experts reach agreement, then their conclusion must be correct. this fallacy occurs when the validity of an argument is based on the number or prestige of those who hold the opinion, rather than on the evidence or reasoning behind it. but again, this scenario does not clearly represent a fallacious argument, as it does not present premises and conclusions in a way that can be classified as a specific type of logical fallacy.

POST: I dont think it depends on the plant.",nothing,"'answer: circular reasoning'
explanation: the reasoning in this case is that if all experts must come to a final agreement, then each expert's thought process will ultimately depend on the thoughts of other experts (i.e., their agreement). however, this is circular reasoning because the conclusion (agreement among experts) depends on the very thing being questioned (the dependency on the plant).",False
883,Are you sure that you understood my question?,nothing,"yes, i understand your question. here's the answer: 'answer: fallacy of many questions'. this is because the scenario describes a process where multiple experts make individual decisions and share their reasoning, but are expected to ultimately reach an agreement. however, if any expert realizes they were wrong at any point during the process, they leave, which means there will be no final agreement among all experts. the 'fallacy of many questions' is a fallacy in argument where multiple separate questions or propositions are presented as a single question or proposition for the sake of deception. in this case, the scenario presents multiple individual reasoning steps as a single decision-making process, which is misleading and therefore falls into the category of 'fallacy of many questions'.",False
884,"Anyway, if you are sure, does Parsnip get boosted?",nothing,"the statement provided is not a clear example of any specific fallacy. it describes a hypothetical scenario without any argument or conclusion being presented. therefore, it is difficult to classify the statement as a fallacy since no reasoning or premises have been stated for analysis.

896,If Kavanaugh is innocent he should be yelling from the hills demanding an investigation by the FBI.,causal oversimplification,"the statement does not clearly present a fallacy in the wording as described. it expresses an opinion about how someone (kavanaugh) should react, but it does not seem to use fallacious reasoning explicitly. however, if we were to analyze it more broadly:

the argument might imply that kavanaugh owes it to himself or others to demand an investigation if he is innocent, suggesting that his innocence somehow justifies this action. this could be seen as an appeal to self-interest fallacy since the action's justification is based on a personal benefit rather than objective evidence or facts.

911,Not sure if Im interpreting what you are saying correctly Im using it as a point that the Postmodernist lens when critiquing literature doesnt include facts in their analysis.,nothing,"answer: answer: equivocation

explanation: in this scenario, the term ""facts"" is ambiguous because it means different things to different experts (the postmodernist lens doesn't include objective facts in their analysis versus other experts who would consider objective facts as crucial in any analysis). therefore, it is a fallacy where an ambiguous term with more than one sense is used, thus making the argument misleading.",False
