**explanation:** the statement describes a scenario where individuals selectively interpret and retain information that confirms their existing beliefs while discarding anything that contradicts those beliefs. this is known as confirmation bias. the experts in the scenario are likely to interpret the information in a way that aligns with their existing beliefs and discard any evidence that contradicts those beliefs, leading to a final agreement that confirms their initial assumptions.",False

**explanation:** the premise suggests that if multiple experts reach an agreement through a specific process, their conclusion must be valid. this ignores the fact that consensus-based conclusions can be flawed, and that the validity of an argument depends on the soundness of its reasoning and the quality of evidence presented, not just the fact that multiple people agree on something.",False

**reasoning:** the premise assumes that if experts agree on something after a collaborative process involving shared thinking and admitting mistakes, then the conclusion must be true. this ignores the fact that groupthink, confirmation bias, and social pressure can influence the outcome of such discussions. the argument fails to establish the necessary condition for the conclusion to be true.",False

8,POST:,nothing,"**answer:** circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise assumes that the experts will automatically correct themselves if they realize they are wrong, thereby guaranteeing eventual agreement. this overlooks the possibility that experts may be stubborn or resistant to changing their minds, even when presented with contradictory evidence.",False

**explanation:** the premise assumes that the experts will come to a final agreement, which means that their initial steps of thinking must be consistent with that final agreement. this creates a circular reasoning where the conclusion (agreement) is used to support the premise (steps of thinking), and the premise is used to support the conclusion.",False
10,It's exactly the same as smurfing.,false analogy,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**explanation:** the premise assumes that if any expert realizes they are wrong at any point, they will leave the group. this implies that the group can never reach a final agreement, as no expert will ever be fully convinced of the conclusion. however, the premise itself relies on the assumption that the group will eventually reach a final agreement, creating a circular reasoning.",False

**explanation:** the premise suggests that the group will engage in a deliberative process where any expert who realizes they are wrong will leave the group. this implies that the group will arrive at a consensus through a logical and transparent process. however, this is not a realistic depiction of how groups function in real-world situations. in actual groups, individuals may be hesitant to depart from the group even when they believe they are wrong, due to factors such as social pressure, group loyalty, or a desire to maintain face. this undermines the validity of the argument by presenting an unrealistic and simplified model of group decision-making.",False
19,We live in one of the best societies in the best times that humans have ever experienced.,circular reasoning,"**answer:** circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise assumes that the experts will unanimously agree on the final outcome, despite any discrepancies or changes in their reasoning during the process. this creates a circular argument where the conclusion is supported by its own premise, without any genuine evaluation of the evidence or logical steps leading to the conclusion.",True

**reasoning:** the premise assumes that if any expert realizes they are wrong at any point, they will leave the group. this implies that the experts are not independent thinkers who can evaluate the evidence and reach their own conclusions. in reality, experts may continue to disagree even after realizing they are wrong about something. therefore, the premise does not guarantee that the experts will ever reach a final agreement.",False
25,Delores is a big supporter for equal pay for equal work.,guilt by association,"**answer:** answer: circular reasoning

**reasoning:** the premise of the argument is that the experts will leave if they realize they are wrong at any point. this implies that the experts are basing their conclusions on their willingness to admit when they are wrong. however, this criterion for agreement is itself a circular reasoning, as it relies on the premise that the experts will act in a certain way (admitting they are wrong) in order to reach the desired conclusion (agreement).",False

**explanation:** the premise of the statement is that if experts disagree at any point in their classification process, they will leave. this implies that the remaining experts must eventually agree, which is a circular reasoning. the statement relies on its own premise (experts will leave if they disagree) to support its conclusion (experts will eventually agree).",False

178,So I really don't think so.,nothing,"**answer:** circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise implies that if any expert realises they are wrong at any point, they will leave the group. this means that the group will always consist of experts who agree with the final agreement, making the final agreement unfalsifiable and therefore not a genuine conclusion based on evidence or reason.",False
179,My way of responding to difficult patients is by far the most ethical because no other way is so ethical and it is the only way that is completely ethical.,circular reasoning,"**answer: argument from uniqueness**

explanation: the argument suggests that because their way of dealing with patients is unique, it must be the most ethical approach. however, the uniqueness of an approach does not automatically make it ethical or effective. ethical decisions should be based on evidence, reason, and a consideration of all relevant factors, not simply on the fact that an approach is unique.",False

**explanation:** the premise implies that china's global power will lead to the collapse of democracy. the conclusion drawn from this premise is that democracy cannot survive if china is the global power. the premise itself is based on the assumption that the existence of a global power will inevitably lead to the collapse of democracy, which is not a proven or universally accepted claim. therefore, the argument is circular, as it relies on its own premise to support its conclusion.",False
182,"Well, democracy gave us Trump to the whole world.",causal oversimplification,"**answer: straw man**

the statement unfairly characterizes the consequences of democracy by equating it with the election of a specific individual (trump). this distorts the actual functioning of democracy, which involves the selection of representatives through fair elections but does not guarantee the election of any particular individual.",False
183,I'll let others judge what democracy is.,causal oversimplification,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**explanation:** the premise implies that if an expert realizes they are wrong at any point, they will leave the group. this means that the experts are required to abandon their initial assumptions as soon as they encounter evidence that contradicts them. this is logically inconsistent. a genuine scientific or intellectual inquiry involves adjusting hypotheses and conclusions in light of new evidence, but abandoning them simply because they are wrong at any point would undermine the entire process of inquiry.",False
184,POST: Lets see what other system gave us.,nothing,"**answer:** appeal to majority

**explanation:** the premise of the argument assumes that all monarchs, theocracies and governments in general have shitty figureheads, regardless of the historical evidence or the quality of leadership during any given period. this generalization is not supported by sufficient evidence and relies on prejudice rather than objective analysis of the merits of different forms of government.",False
188,That doesnt prove anything.,nothing,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**reasoning:** the premise of the argument is that if any expert realizes they are wrong at any point, they will leave. this implies that the experts are basing their conclusions on their own previous conclusions, rather than on objective evidence or reasoning. this creates a circular reasoning pattern, where the conclusion is supported by itself rather than by any external evidence or reasoning.",False
189,"At least in democracy we have the chance to switch them, you know what they do in other forms of government?",nothing,"**answer:** circular reasoning

193,"German Shepherds are dogs; therefore, German Shepherds would be good inside dogs, too.",false analogy,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**explanation:**

the premise describes a hypothetical experiment involving multiple experts reaching an agreement through an iterative process. this scenario does not relate to the claim that the united states is the wealthiest nation in the world, and therefore, does not constitute a fallacy.",False
201,So every American is wealthy.,fallacy of division,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**explanation:** the premise assumes that if any expert realizes they are wrong at any point, they will leave the group. this means that the experts are required to be able to change their minds when presented with new information, which is a reasonable expectation. however, the premise then contradicts itself by claiming that the experts must come to a final agreement, regardless of whether any of them have changed their minds. this creates a circular reasoning fallacy, as the conclusion (final agreement) depends on the premise (experts can change their minds), which in turn depends on the conclusion (experts must come to a final agreement).",False

213,You should never gamble.,slippery slope,"answer: circular reasoning

**reasoning:** the premise implies that the experts will rationally reach an agreement through a process of shared reasoning. however, the rule that anyone who realizes they are wrong must leave implies that the experts' conclusions are not based on reason but rather on their willingness to conform to the group. this circular reasoning creates a flawed argument because the conclusion (agreement) is dependent on the premise (experts will conform to the group), which is in turn dependent on the conclusion (agreement).",False
214,Once you start gambling you find it hard to stop.,slippery slope,"**answer: appeal to sunk cost.**

**explanation:** this statement employs the ""appeal to authority fallacy"". the premise of the argument is that because experts disagree on the effectiveness of the two approaches, neither can be the definitive solution. however, the argument fails to acknowledge that expert disagreement is not necessarily an indicator of either approach's ineffectiveness. the statement incorrectly concludes that the lack of consensus among experts necessarily implies that neither approach is effective.",False

**explanation:** confirmation bias is a cognitive bias where an individual selectively interprets information in a way that confirms their existing beliefs or hypotheses. in the given scenario, the experts are likely to interpret the information in a way that aligns with their existing beliefs about a particular classification. if any expert discovers that their initial classification is incorrect, they promptly leave the group, potentially leading to a confirmation bias among the remaining experts.",False
