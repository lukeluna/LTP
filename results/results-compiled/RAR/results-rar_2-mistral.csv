**segment:** i heard that the catholic church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up. consequently, my 102-year-old catholic neighbor, who frequently attends church, is also guilty.

#### response template:
the passage demonstrates the fallacy of [ad hominem]. this fallacy occurs when someone attacks the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself. in this case, the argument implies that because the neighbor belongs to the same religious institution as those involved in a scandal, they too must be guilty without providing any evidence or reasoning supporting that claim.",False
