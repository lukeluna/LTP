response template: the segment contains the fallacy of appeal to nature. this fallacy occurs when an argument is made based on the idea that something is good or bad simply because it is 'natural' or 'unnatural.' in this case, the segment implies that climate change is causing people to leave the marshall islands because it is a natural occurrence and thus must be responsible for these changes.",False

response:
the segment contains the fallacy of straw man. this fallacy occurs when an argument is misrepresented in order to make it easier to attack, which is evident in the statement as it presents the ipcc's conclusion in a way that implies the entire temperature increase is attributed to human emissions, while the report actually states that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase.",False

**segment:** the amount of summer sea ice in the arctic has steadily declined over the past few decades because of man-made global warming, according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration.

#### response template:
the segment contains the fallacy of appeal to authority. this fallacy occurs when an argument is considered valid or correct solely based on the credibility or expertise of the source making the claim, rather than evaluating the actual evidence presented. in this case, the author relies on the authority of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration without providing further supporting evidence for the claim about the decline in summer sea ice in the arctic.",False

response: the segment contains the fallacy of slippery slope. this fallacy occurs when a minor action or event is argued to lead to major and often ludicrous consequences. in this case, the statement implies that if carbon emissions continue on a worst-case scenario, the entire ice in west antarctica will be freed up, which is an exaggeration of potential outcomes.",False

segment: the ‘ancient carbon’ of alaska’s tundras is being released, starting a vicious warming cycle. this is ancient carbon, thousands and millions of years old. it’s being released much earlier than we thought.

response template:
the segment contains the fallacy of appeal to tradition. this fallacy occurs when an argument is made that something is better because it is traditional. in this case, the statement implies that the release of ancient carbon from alaska's tundras is a problematic event solely due to its being out of the ordinary or early occurrence in traditionally understood timelines.",False

response template:
the segment contains the fallacy of causal oversimplification. this fallacy occurs when a single cause is attributed to an outcome that has multiple causes, leading to an oversimplified understanding of the situation. in this case, the connection between vanishing arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere may be influenced by other factors as well, making it an overly simplistic conclusion.",False

We’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods.",nothing,"rephrased question: which type of logical error is present in the provided statement about surface ocean temperatures leading to more floods due to increased water vapor in the atmosphere?

response template: the statement contains the fallacy of hasty generalization. this fallacy occurs when a conclusion is drawn based on a small sample size or limited evidence, as opposed to sufficient data that can support the claim. in this case, the statement makes a generalized claim about the relationship between ocean surface temperatures and floods, without providing adequate evidence or considering other factors that may influence the occurrence of floods.",False

segment: in 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100. but now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible.

response template: the segment contains the fallacy of appeal to tradition. this fallacy occurs when an argument is presented as valid or true simply because it has been accepted or practiced in the past, without considering the evidence or logical reasoning behind it. in this case, the initial consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise was used as a basis for further discussion and analysis, but the segment does not provide any evidence to support why that conclusion should still be valid today.",False
