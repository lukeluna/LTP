365,"Healthy brains think. Healthy brains are comprised of nothing but brain cells. If healthy brains think, then the individual brain cells can think too.",fallacy of division,"**step 1:**
**expert 1:** causal oversimplification. the argument assumes that healthy brains are solely composed of brain cells, ignoring other factors that contribute to cognition.


**expert 2:** false analogy. the argument compares healthy brains to individual brain cells, but brains are complex systems with multiple interacting parts.


**expert 3:** circular reasoning. the argument relies on the premise that healthy brains think, which is being used to conclude that individual brain cells can think.


**final answer:** **circular reasoning**

the argument commits a circular reasoning fallacy because it uses the very conclusion (healthy brains think) as a premise to support the conclusion (individual brain cells can think).",False

367,"Like countless other organisms, we move and adapt when the environment changes. Species thrive when it is warm.",false analogy,"**step 1: expert 1**
the premise that species thrive when the environment is warm suggests a casual relationship between temperature and species survival.

**step 1: expert 2**
however, temperature is just one of many factors that can affect species survival. other factors such as food availability, shelter availability, and predation pressure also play a role.

**final answer: causal oversimplification**

---

**step 2: expert 1**
therefore, the argument lacks sufficient evidence to establish that temperature is the primary factor influencing species survival.

458,I dont care. Since the attacks from cologne i know how what refugees are: Criminals. And criminals dont belong here. Send them all back!,hasty generalization,"**step 1: expert 1**
the statement implies a generalization about all refugees based on the actions of some refugees from cologne.

461,There do exist local environment task forces. They all do a good job. Therefore a global environment task force has to be good as well.,hasty generalization,"**step 1:**
**expert 1:** this argument commits a **hasty generalization** fallacy. the argument assumes that because local environment task forces are good, a global environment task force must also be good, without sufficient evidence to support this conclusion.


**step 2:**
**expert 2:** however, local environment task forces are often focused on specific areas with limited resources and challenges. a global environment task force would likely face different challenges and require different approaches.


**step 3:**
**expert 1:** but surely a global task force could draw on the expertise of local task forces and implement similar strategies on a larger scale.


**step 4:**
**expert 3:** this argument overlooks the fact that global challenges require different solutions than local challenges. the complexity and scale of environmental issues differ significantly between local and global contexts.


**final answer:** **nothing**

**expert 3:** the argument ignores the fact that plastic surgery is used for non-cosmetic purposes and can have both positive and negative consequences.


**step 2:**

**expert 1:** now i realize my previous classification was incorrect. the argument actually commits a **false analogy**. the fact that some people need plastic surgery after horrific accidents does not necessarily mean that all plastic surgery is good or necessary.
