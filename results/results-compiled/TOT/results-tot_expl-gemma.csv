**step 1:** expert 3: circular reasoning. the argument assumes that prayer can influence weather, and then uses that assumption to support the conclusion that their prayers caused the clear skies.


**step 2:** expert 1 revises: appeal to natural phenomenon. the argument suggests that the clear skies were simply due to natural weather patterns, not the prayers.


**step 2:** expert 2 revises: insufficient evidence. there is no credible scientific evidence to support the claim that prayer can influence weather.


**step 2:** expert 3 revises: fallacy of oversimplification. the argument ignores the numerous factors that contribute to weather patterns, suggesting that prayer alone could be responsible for the clear skies.


**final answer:** answer: fallacy of oversimplification. the argument simplifies the complex process of weather formation by attributing the clear skies solely to the individual's prayers, neglecting the numerous environmental and meteorological factors involved.",False
405,I saw a shooting star and made a wish and it came true. As if I needed more proof that shooting stars grant wishes.,false causality,"**step 1:** expert 1: appeal to authority. the statement implies that shooting stars have a supernatural power to grant wishes, citing personal experience as evidence.


**step 1:** expert 2: circular reasoning. the statement assumes that because people often make wishes when they see shooting stars, their appearance must be related to the manifestation of those wishes.


**step 1:** expert 3: appeal to positive emotion. the statement suggests that the coincidence of witnessing a shooting star and having a wish fulfilled is proof of the power of shooting stars, appealing to the emotional desire of people to believe in magic and serendipity.


**step 2:** expert 1 leaves. the argument lacks credible authority to establish the supernatural nature of shooting stars.


**step 2:** expert 2 notes the lack of empirical evidence to support the connection between shooting stars and wish fulfillment.


**step 2:** expert 3 revises their stance, acknowledging the absence of definitive scientific evidence to confirm the claim.


**final answer:** answer: nothing. the premise lacks credible evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim that shooting stars grant wishes.",False

**step 1: expert 2:** the argument relies on a generalization that every time a black cat is seen something bad will happen, which ignores the numerous instances where black cats have not caused any misfortune.


**step 1: expert 3:** the statement lacks logical reasoning as it implies that the presence of a black cat directly causes misfortune, rather than considering other factors that may contribute to negative events.


**final answer:** answer: appeal to coincidence.

**explanation:** the argument confuses the correlation between observing a black cat and subsequent negative events with the casual relationship between the two.",False
408,The flu shot caused me to get COVID-19 - I tested positive for COVID-19 after getting the flu shot.,false causality,"**step 1:** expert 1: this is an anecdotal report, not a valid scientific conclusion.

**step 2:** expert 2: correlation does not necessarily imply causation. the flu shot may simply be ineffective against covid-19 or the person may have been exposed to the virus shortly after receiving the flu shot.

**step 3:** expert 3: lack of evidence to support the claim that the flu shot causes covid-19.

**final answer:** answer: nothing

**explanation:** the experts recognize that the available evidence does not support the claim that the flu shot causes covid-19.",False
409,I tested positive for COVID-19 after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine must have caused me to get infected.,false causality,"**step 1:** expert 1: appeal to correlation - the presence of two events in close proximity may be misleading as to their causal connection.

**step 2:** expert 2: confirmation bias - seeking information that confirms existing beliefs while ignoring or discounting contradicting evidence.

410,I wore a mask and still got COVID-19. Masks must not be effective in preventing transmission.,false causality,"**step 1:** expert 1: the statement implies that masks are completely ineffective, but there is evidence suggesting they can reduce transmission.

**step 2:** expert 2: expert 1's conclusion is premature as there could be other factors contributing to the individual's covid-19 infection beyond just mask-wearing.

**step 3:** expert 1: but if masks are not effective, why are health authorities recommending them?

**step 4:** expert 3: the statement overlooks the possibility that masks might not be 100% effective but still significantly reduce the risk of transmission.

**final answer:** answer: appeal to authority. the statement incorrectly concludes that masks are ineffective based on the premise that their use eliminates the risk of covid-19 transmission, overlooking the fact that other factors might be at play.",False
411,I took zinc supplements and didn't get COVID-19. Zinc must be the key to immunity against the virus.,false causality,"**step 1:** expert 1: this reasoning relies on anecdotal evidence, not controlled studies or large-scale data, to support the conclusion.

**step 2:** expert 2: the correlation between zinc supplements and avoiding covid-19 may not be statistically significant or applicable to the broader population.

**step 3:** expert 3: the absence of evidence from controlled studies or long-term data makes it premature to conclude that zinc supplements can prevent covid-19.

**answer:** nothing.

the argument lacks sufficient scientific evidence, controlled studies, or population-level data to establish a casual relationship between zinc supplements and immunity against covid-19.",False
412,Extreme weather-related deaths in the U.S. have decreased by more than 98% over the last 100 years... Global warming saves lives.,false causality,"**step 1: expert 1:** the statement suggests that global warming has led to a reduction in extreme weather-related deaths.

**step 1: expert 2:** the statement is likely based on the premise that extreme weather events were more frequent or deadly in the past than they are today.

**step 1: expert 3:** the statement might be omitting other factors that could contribute to the reduction in extreme weather-related deaths, such as improved disaster preparedness and infrastructure.

**step 2: expert 1:** extreme weather events may still occur, but with less frequency or intensity due to global warming.

**step 2: expert 2:** the reduction in deaths could also be due to changes in human behavior, such as better evacuation and shelter procedures.

**step 2: expert 3:** it's possible that the reduction in deaths is not solely due to global warming but may also be influenced by other factors like improved technology and infrastructure.

**final answer:** answer: appeal to natural selection.

**explanation:** the argument suggests that global warming has saved lives based on the reduction in extreme weather-related deaths over the past century. however, this overlooks other potential factors that could contribute to the reduction in deaths, such as human actions and technological advancements.",False
413,Every severe recession follows a Republican Presidency; therefore Republicans are the cause of recessions.,false causality,"**step 1:** expert 1: this argument commits a tu quoque fallacy. the premise assumes that all republican presidencies are accompanied by severe recessions, which is not supported by historical evidence.


**step 2:** expert 2: expert 1 is correct. the argument ignores other potential factors that contribute to recessions, such as economic policies, market conditions, and technological advancements.

**final answer:** answer: nothing",False
414,“But like most claims regarding global warming the real effect is small and most likely due to natural weather patterns. Any changes in hurricanes over 70 years can easily be part of natural cycles — or incomplete data. Coastal lake sediments along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from 1000 to 2000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today.,false causality,"**step 1:** the argument suggests that the current observed changes in hurricanes are likely part of natural cycles rather than human-caused climate change.

**expert 1:** answer: appeal to natural cycles. the argument relies on the assumption that natural weather patterns can explain the observed changes in hurricanes.

**expert 2:** answer: data completeness. the argument suggests that the data on hurricanes over the past 70 years might be incomplete or biased.

**expert 3:** answer: nothing. the argument provides evidence from coastal lake sediments suggesting more frequent and intense hurricanes in the past, which could undermine the claim that current changes are unprecedented.

**final answer:** answer: appeal to natural cycles and data completeness.",False
415,I drank bottled water and now I am sick. The water must have made me sick.,false causality,"**step 1:** expert 1: appeal to correlation - the presence of two events in close proximity suggests that one caused the other.

**expert 1:** appeal to comparison. the argument suggests that because inception did not win 11 oscars, titanic should not win 11 oscars either, simply because both movies had leonardo dicaprio as the main actor.


**expert 2:** fallacy of faulty analogy. the comparison between the two movies is not valid because other factors besides the main actor influence the number of oscars awarded.
