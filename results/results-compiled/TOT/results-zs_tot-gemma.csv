expert 1: this argument implies a causal connection between deforestation and climate change, specifically that deforestation diminishes forest as a carbon sink.


expert 2: the argument relies on an analogy between deforestation and natural resource depletion, suggesting that deforestation is analogous to losing forests as a carbon sink.


expert 3: the argument lacks specific evidence or data to support the claim that deforestation directly reduces the carbon-absorbing capacity of forests.


**step 2:**

expert 1: the argument appears to employ a ""straw man"" fallacy by presenting an exaggerated or simplified version of the opposing argument (maintaining that deforestation completely eliminates the carbon-absorbing capacity of forests).


expert 2: the argument might also involve an ""equivocation"" fallacy, conflating the loss of trees as carbon sinks with other ecosystem services provided by forests.
