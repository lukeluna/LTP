36,"For such is the power true Godhead that it cannot be altogether and utterly hidden from the rational creature, once it makes use of its reason. For with the exception of a few in whom nature is excessively depraved, the whole human race confesses God to be author of the world.",ad populum,"'answer: appeal to universal acceptance'
explanation: the argument relies on the fact that most people accept something (in this case, the existence of god) as evidence for its truth. however, the truth of an idea should not depend solely on how many people believe it. it can still be false even if a majority believes in it. this is a fallacy because it assumes that what is commonly accepted must necessarily be true.",False
37,"If all that the senses present to the mind is sensations, Berkeley must be right — but Berkeley assumed this premiss without any foundation or any proof of it. The size and shape of things are presented to us by our senses, yet every one knows that size and shape are not sensations.",ad populum,answer: questionable premise,False

39,"The Trump administration is being sued over its plans to include a question about citizenship in the 2020 Census, which California Attorney General Xavier Becerra says ‘is not just a bad idea — it is illegal.’ No, it's not. There is nothing wrong with asking about citizenship. Canada asks a citizenship question on its census. So do Australia and many other U.S. allies.",ad populum,"answer: appeal to false authority
explanation: the argument relies on the fact that canada and australia also ask a citizenship question on their census as evidence for the claim that it's not illegal to do so in the u.s. however, the legality of asking about citizenship in a country's census is a matter of law specific to that country, and simply pointing out that other countries do it does not prove that it is legal in the u.s. in this case, the argument is using other countries as an authority on the legality of u.s. actions, when they are not actually authorities on this issue.",False
40,Some of you hold to the doctrine of States' Rights as applying to woman suffrage. Adherence to that theory will keep the United States far behind all other democratic nations upon this question.

41,"The human soul is immortal, because all learned men agree that anything which does not come out of the potentiality of matter is incorruptible and immortal.",ad populum,"answer: fallacy of authority (circular reasoning)

explanation: the claim relies on the premise that ""anything which does not come out of the potentiality of matter is incorruptible and immortal"" to support its conclusion that the human soul is immortal. however, this premise itself is based on an unsubstantiated assumption that whatever learned men agree upon is true. this creates a circular reasoning where the conclusion is supported by the same premise that requires proof in the first place. furthermore, the argument assumes that the definition of ""anything which does not come out of the potentiality of matter"" being incorruptible and immortal is universally agreed upon by all learned men, which may not be the case. this fallacy can also be seen as an appeal to authority because it relies on the agreement of learned men rather than providing evidence or logical reasoning for its claim.",False

He is so nearly right, his ideals are so very high, that most people assent — while they have no difficulty in evading them and going on their way as if a breath of wind had fanned their faces, and no voice of truth had stirred their spirits.",ad populum,"'answer: appeal to authority (with a hint of false dilemma)'
explanation: the statement appeals to the authority of mr. raskin, implying that his ideals being nearly right make him an authority. however, without evidence or reason provided for his alleged expertise in the subject matter, it's not clear that he truly is an authority. moreover, the implication that people should assent to mr. raskin's ideas because they find them appealing seems to present only two options: either agreeing with him or dismissing him as irrelevant. this suggests a fallacy of false dilemma, where more than two choices exist and are not considered.",False
45,"International inspectors would monitor Iran's facilities, and if Iran is caught breaking the agreement economic sanctions would be imposed again. … Snapback sanctions? Everyone knows that once the international sanctions are lifted, they are never coming back.",ad populum,answer: appeal to popular belief,False

51,"I get mad when i think about all these poor guys on the street, having no home, no job, no family. All because they started taking drugs. Its so sad, we need heavier penalties.",appeal to anger,"'answer: appeal to emotion'

explanation: the argument is trying to manipulate emotions (sympathy for the homeless) to make a conclusion (heavier penalties) seem reasonable. however, emotional appeals do not provide substantial evidence in favor of the argument.",False

59,People are fed up. They've had enough with the bickering and the partisanship that seems to characterize the debate that goes on in the nation's capital.,appeal to anger,"answer: circular reasoning
explanation: the argument relies on its premise (the people being fed up with bickering and partisanship) to support its conclusion that the people are fed up, creating a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared.",False
60,The media is constantly spreading lies and misinformation to manipulate us. It's time to rise up and demand the truth!,appeal to anger,answer: appeal to emotion,False
61,"How dare they try to censor our freedom of speech! We have the right to express ourselves however we want, and anyone who tries to silence us is a tyrant!",appeal to anger,"answer: slippery slope fallacy. explanation: the argument is that if one takes away someone's freedom of speech, it will eventually lead to censorship of all forms and tyranny. however, the argument leaps from the specific case (restricting free speech in a particular context) to the general case (tyranny), making an unjustified assumption about what the consequences of that restriction would be. the argument is fallacious because it oversimplifies the complexities of political power and the relationship between freedom of speech, censorship, and tyranny.",False
62,Those protesters are nothing but troublemakers causing chaos in our streets. They need to be stopped by any means necessary!,appeal to anger,answer: slippery slope,False
63,I'm sick and tired of these so-called experts telling us what to do. We don't need their condescending lectures; we need action!,appeal to anger,answer: appeal to emotion,False

75,My brother said Messi has won more trophies with Barcelona than he has with Real Madrid so he does not deserve the trophy.,appeal to (false) authority,"answer: false dilemma. explanation: the statement is suggesting that messi can only deserve a trophy if he wins more with one team than another, which ignores the possibility that messi could still deserve the trophy even if his numbers are not as high for a particular team. this argument assumes that a player's worthiness of a trophy solely depends on winning more for one team than another, which is a false dilemma since there may be other factors to consider when determining a player's deservingness.",False
76,"Yes, ask the guys from PETA, of course they need special rights.",appeal to (false) authority,"'answer: appeal to emotion'
explanation: the statement is trying to manipulate the emotions of the reader by appealing to compassion for animals, rather than providing logical arguments or evidence as to why animals should have special rights.",False
77,My boyfriend has the opinion that Apple has only his profit on his mind. So Apple 's swift will be a fail.,appeal to (false) authority,"answer: nothing (or potentially equivocation, depending on whether 'swift' refers to the car or the company)

explanation: the reasoning provided does not show any fallacy within it. the statement is merely stating an opinion and then predicting an outcome based on that opinion. no logical error is made in this argument. however, if the term 'swift' is being used ambiguously to refer both to the car model and the company, then it could be considered equivocation. but without further context, it's hard to definitively say for sure.",False
78,My teacher alwas took away our phones when we used them during class. I am sure he had a reason.,appeal to (false) authority,answer: appeal to authority (without justification),False
79,My teacher said global warming is a myth so therefore there is no global warming.,appeal to (false) authority,answer: false cause fallacy,False

81,My mother says always that the non- European immigrans destroy our culture.,appeal to (false) authority,"the statement does not explicitly describe a step-by-step reasoning process among experts, so it is not possible to classify it as a specific fallacy according to the given format. however, the content of the statement seems to involve an appeal to tradition (argument based on historical preferences), guilt by association (associating negative traits with a group due to shared characteristics), and potentially ethnic bias or prejudice (negative stereotypes about non-european immigrants). if rephrased as a reasoning process among experts, it could be classified as 'answer: appeal to tradition and guilt by association'.",False

83,"My friend said, that human dignity is more important.",appeal to (false) authority,answer: nothing (this statement does not present a fallacy as it does not contain an argument or reasoning with logical flaws),False
84,In TV they said celebrities are treated better.,appeal to (false) authority,"the reasoning provided does not seem to be a fallacy, but it is a hypothetical scenario without enough information to classify it as a specific fallacy. here is an analysis if we assume the scenario as stated in the question:

1. the first expert might say: ""three experts have been assigned to classify this scenario."" (no fallacy)
2. the second expert might say: ""the classification should be based on whether or not it meets the criteria for a fallacy, and if they all agree on the answer, that would mean there is no fallacy present."" (no fallacy)
3. the third expert might say: ""however, the question only provides a description of how the experts will approach the classification, but there is no actual scenario or argument to classify. therefore, we cannot determine whether it is a fallacy or not based on this information alone."" (no fallacy if we assume that the scenario continues with the experts being presented an argument to classify)
4. if the third expert realizes they are wrong at this point and leaves, there will be no final agreement among the experts, thus implying that there might not be enough information to reach a consensus. (no fallacy if we assume that the scenario continues with the experts being presented an argument to classify)
5. if the third expert does not leave and proceeds to the next step, it is unclear what the next steps would be since there is no argument provided for them to classify. (no fallacy if we assume that the scenario continues with the experts being presented an argument to classify)
6. without an actual argument or scenario to analyze, we cannot definitively say whether the reasoning described in the question is a fallacy or not. therefore, 'answer: nothing'.",False
85,A good friend of mine explains day by dy why we absolutely should operate with military operations against the IS and he is absolutely right!,appeal to (false) authority,'answer: appeal to friendship',False
86,My husband says the musicians earn enough. Why pay them extra?,appeal to (false) authority,"answer: false dilemma (or possibly circular reasoning, depending on how the argument is further developed)

explanation: the statement presents only two options (paying the musicians or not paying them), implying that there are no other alternatives. however, in reality, there may be other ways to compensate the musicians that are not being considered. additionally, if the husband's position is based on the assumption that his wife should follow his argument because he believes the musicians earn enough, then the statement could also be seen as circular reasoning (the husband's belief about whether the musicians earn enough is used to justify not paying them extra).",False
87,"My friend said that it is important for victims of disfiguration. Therefore, it is an important field of medicine.",appeal to (false) authority,"the given statement does not necessarily contain a fallacy. however, if we analyze the reasoning process presented in the statement, it can be argued that it is a form of appeal to emotion, as the argument is trying to make the field appear important by appealing to our sympathy for victims of disfigurement. but this is not explicitly stated in the given description as the reasoning steps are not provided.

answer: 'answer: possibly appeal to emotion'",False
88,My brother said that he hasn't heard of this language before. It is obviously bad.,appeal to (false) authority,answer: appeal to ignorance,False
89,Did you read the Book from Jordan Belfort or watch his movie wolf of wallstreet? Money is everything. Economical growth means more money.,appeal to (false) authority,"answer: false cause

explanation: the argument assumes that because one watched a movie about a character who values money highly and experienced economical growth, the same relationship between money and economic growth exists in real life. however, there's no evidence or justification to support this assumption.",False
90,My christian friend is says that every christian is against any kind of violence. I trust his words.,appeal to (false) authority,answer: appeal to (false) authority,True
91,"But many guys from my programming-course say, that only C is the real programming-language and that Apples Swift is for hipsters only.",appeal to (false) authority,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation (step by step):
1. the opinion of many guys from the programming course is presented as a fact (that c is the real programming language).
2. another opinion, that apple's swift is for hipsters only, is presented to further support this initial claim.
3. however, the second claim is based on the first one, which in turn is based solely on the opinions of those guys from the programming course. therefore, neither claim has any independent evidence or justification.
4. as a result, both claims are based on each other and rely on their own premise to support themselves, creating a circular reasoning fallacy where no useful information is being shared in the argument.",False
92,"I am working for UPS and my boss said, that this strike is not justified.",appeal to (false) authority,"answer: fallacy of appeals to authority (specifically an appeal to a biased authority)

explanation: the reasoning here is that the expert's (in this case, the boss's) opinion is being used as evidence in an argument without considering whether they are truly an authority on the issue at hand or if they may have biases that affect their perspective. in this scenario, the boss may be biased because it is their job to manage the workers and they could potentially lose power if the strike is deemed justified.",False

95,"Yes, all the polar-bears are dying, and we are next.",appeal to fear,answer: false dilemma,False
96,"Yes, you certainly don't want your children to die from this virus.",appeal to fear,"'answer: false dilemma'
explanation: the statement presents only two choices (the experts either agree or leave) while more exist (the experts could continue discussing, researching, and reaching a consensus in other ways). it creates a fallacy by presenting a limited number of options when there are actually more available.",False
97,"When we go to war, we kill children with drones and kill innocent civilians.",appeal to fear,"the statement does not provide enough information for a definitive classification of a specific fallacy. however, it seems to contain elements of an emotional argument (appeal to emotion), as the focus is on the tragic consequences of going to war rather than presenting facts or reasons for the conclusion. additionally, it may imply that those responsible for military operations are callous and indifferent towards human life (guilt by association). if this inference is intended, then it would also be a fallacy. however, without more context or information about who is making these arguments, it is not possible to confirm with certainty whether the statement contains any specific fallacies.

answer: answer: possible appeal to emotion and guilt by association",False
98,"If people smoke at home they hurt their family-members, the one they love, through passive-smoke. It was such a shame if this was not illegal.",appeal to fear,answer: argument from personal incitement,False

119,I understand your concerns but national security should be our top priority. Without this policy we're leaving ourselves vulnerable to potential threats.,appeal to fear,"answer: sliding scale argument or gradated scale reasoning (also known as the fallacy of many questions) - the statement presents a situation where two values (security and personal privacy) are in conflict, and instead of addressing both equally, it places them on a scale, with national security being considered more important than personal privacy. this is a logical fallacy because not all things can be measured or weighed against each other in this manner, especially when they are fundamentally different concepts.",False

explanation: the statement implies that there are only two choices, either helping the planet or using natural resources. however, it is possible to use natural resources responsibly and help the planet at the same time by implementing sustainable practices, reducing waste, and promoting renewable energy sources. therefore, more than just these two choices exist in this scenario.",False
125,Yes humans destroy natural places for their own sake,appeal to nature,"answer: circular reasoning. the argument relies on its premise (humans destroy natural places) to support its conclusion (humans do it for their own sake), creating a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared.",False

136,"Herbal supplements are derived from plants, so they’re safer than prescription drugs.",appeal to nature,"answer: fallacy of false cause

142,Using essential oils instead of manufactured perfumes is healthier because they come directly from plants.,appeal to nature,"answer: false cause (also known as hasty generalization or fallacy of insufficient sampling)
explanation: the claim that all essential oils are healthier than manufactured perfumes, based solely on the fact that they originate from plants, is a hasty generalization. this is because not all things derived from nature are necessarily better for us, and not every synthetic substance is unhealthy. moreover, the health benefits of essential oils depend on factors such as quality, purity, and proper usage. therefore, the conclusion that essential oils are healthier than manufactured perfumes based solely on their origin is a fallacy of false cause.",False
143,It's better to drink untreated spring water than filtered or bottled water because it’s closer to its original state.,appeal to nature,"answer: false cause (or fallacy of causation)

explanation: the statement suggests that the fact that spring water is in its ""original state"" causes it to be healthier or safer. however, this assumption does not take into account other factors such as contamination, mineral content, or purification methods that could impact the quality of the water. therefore, the claim that spring water is healthier or safer because it's closer to its original state is a fallacy because there may be other causal factors at play that were not considered in this argument.",False

147,Meditation in the forest is more effective than practicing in a city apartment because it aligns more with how humans are meant to relax.,appeal to nature,"answer: false cause (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc)

explanation: the statement assumes that because meditation in a forest is more peaceful and quiet compared to a city apartment, it automatically means that's the most effective way for humans to relax. however, this argument does not provide any evidence or proof demonstrating that practicing meditation in a forest directly causes more relaxation than doing it in a city apartment. there could be several other factors at play that influence the effectiveness of meditation, such as an individual's state of mind, their focus, and personal preferences, among others. the reasoning here is based on the correlation between location and relaxation without establishing a causal relationship.",False

149,Eating meat from wild animals is healthier than eating farm-raised meat because it’s closer to what was originally available.,appeal to nature,"answer: false dilemma (or, if you prefer to separate this into a series of steps, then step 1: the argument presents only two options - eating meat from wild animals vs. eating farm-raised meat; step 2: there are other options such as not consuming meat at all or choosing sustainably farmed meat, which makes the presented options incomplete)",False

155,These sweet gorillas would die in the wild. Predators are vile in their natural habitat and zoos only protect these sweet animals.,appeal to pity,"the statement seems to be an argument for keeping gorillas in zoos rather than releasing them into the wild, which is not a fallacy. however, the reasoning provided is not clear or complete enough to classify as a specific fallacy within the given context.

166,"My uncle watched one of his movies and kicked his dog. Dogs should not be kicked, so his movies must be too violent, or don't you think dogs should not be kicked?",appeal to pity,"answer: fallacy of equivocation
explanation: the word ""kicked"" is used in two different senses here - first as a verb referring to the act of hitting, and second as an adjective meaning violent. this confusion creates a misleading argument. if the argument were to be correct, it should not use the same term with multiple meanings without clarification, leading to a fallacy of equivocation.",False

171,I dont want people to die. That is so sad and makes me cry. But sometimes brave men have to stand up against tyranny. Justice has to be served.,appeal to pity,"'answer: appeal to emotion'

174,Maybe for you. Many people feel the pressure and are totally down. They have to cry and cannot feel love anymore.,appeal to pity,"answer: equivocation. the statement uses the word ""cry"" in two different senses, one being an emotional outburst and the other referring to not being able to feel love. this ambiguity makes the argument misleading.",False
175,Imagine cute baby-gorillas in a prison! I say: NO,appeal to pity,"answer: false dilemma. explanation: the argument presents an extreme scenario (baby gorillas in prison) which is not relevant or applicable to the situation at hand (the decision making process of experts). by doing so, it limits the discussion to two choices when more exist (either agreeing or disagreeing with the statement), thus creating a false dilemma.",False
176,"The grading system used in high school is ineffective. So many kids strive in fields other than math and English, think of all the potential lost by failing them and making them lose confidence.",appeal to pity,"answer: false cause
explanation: the argument assumes that the current grading system causes a lack of success in fields other than math and english, but this is not proven or even necessarily true. it might simply be that students are naturally more interested in these subjects, rather than the grading system being the cause.",False

182,"No, because all people are the same. You are not worth more than me, just because you are a doctor.",appeal to ridicule,answer: false equivalence,False
183,Do you really think that people who delight us with wonderful music should live like the poor?,appeal to ridicule,"the reasoning provided does not necessarily represent a fallacy, but it can be interpreted as an example of the ""slippery slope"" fallacy. this is because the argument suggests that if musicians are allowed to live comfortably, then everyone will have to live like them (the poorest). however, the statement only presents one extreme (musicians living well) and another extreme (living like the poor), without considering other possibilities in between.

it can be argued that this is not a strict slippery slope fallacy because there's no explicit claim about what will happen if musicians live comfortably. instead, the statement is questioning whether it's fair for musicians to live well when others are struggling. but by implying that granting musicians more comfort automatically leads to everyone suffering, it may be seen as a subtle example of the slippery slope fallacy.

therefore, the answer would be 'answer: possible slippery slope fallacy'. however, depending on context and interpretation, it might not strictly qualify as a slippery slope fallacy.",False
184,"You couldn't possibly buy that wile thinking about all the poor, abused people who were exploited to produce these things.",appeal to ridicule,answer: appeal to emotion,False
185,I like how celebrities are treated like non-celebrities when it comes to the law.,appeal to ridicule,answer: appeal to celebrity,False

204,"The English language has always been taught using textbooks and grammar rules, so using immersive language learning apps is just a fad that won't be as effective.",appeal to tradition,"answer: false dichotomy (also known as the fallacy of the excluded middle)
explanation: the argument presents only two options, textbooks and grammar rules, or immersive language learning apps, for teaching english language. however, there are more ways to learn a language than just these two methods. for instance, learning through real-life interaction with native speakers, watching movies, listening to music, etc., are also valid means of acquiring the language.",False

207,Internet censorship in the US isn't as bad as internet censorship in China. Don't complain.,appeal to worse problems,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement suggests that there are only two possible scenarios for internet censorship - it is either as bad as in china or not complaint worthy. however, there may be a spectrum of scenarios between the two extremes, such as internet censorship being somewhat bad in the us but less severe than in china. therefore, the speaker is creating a false dichotomy by presenting only two options when more exist.",False

211,Why are we concerned about income inequality when there are countries where people are living in extreme poverty without access to basic necessities like clean water and shelter?,appeal to worse problems,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents only two issues, income inequality and people lacking access to basic necessities, but fails to consider that addressing one issue (income inequality) can help address the other (lack of access to basic necessities). it is a fallacy because it oversimplifies the situation by presenting only extreme options instead of considering all possible solutions or actions that could be taken.",False
212,"Yes, there's corruption in our government, but have you seen the atrocities committed by dictatorships in other parts of the world?",appeal to worse problems,answer: appeal to fear (or negative example),False

214,"Yes, there are issues with police misconduct in our country, but in some nations, the police are outright oppressive and engage in widespread human rights abuses. Our situation isn't nearly as bad.",appeal to worse problems,"answer: false dichotomy (or sliding scale fallacy)

explanation: the statement presents a false choice by assuming that because the situation in our country is not as bad as in some other nations, it must mean our situation is not that serious. this fallacy can be committed when a speaker or writer makes it seem like only two possibilities exist, whereas more exist. in this case, there are many levels of police misconduct and human rights abuses, not just ""our country"" and ""other nations where the situation is worse.""",False

219,"You're concerned about mental health stigma in our society? In some cultures, mental illness is not even recognized and people receive no help at all.",appeal to worse problems,"answer: circular reasoning
explanation: the argument states that mental illness is not recognized or treated in some cultures because there is a lack of recognition and treatment for mental illness in those societies (which implies mental illness exists). however, the statement itself assumes that mental illness exists and needs to be recognized and treated. therefore, the conclusion is being supported by the same premise (the existence of mental illness), creating a circular argument where no useful information is being shared.",False

228,"Sure, US forces tortured people in Afghanistan, but it's not as bad as what the Japanese did in WWII.",appeal to worse problems,"answer: appeal to extreme (or ""whataboutism"")
explanation: the statement defends a potentially unjust or questionable action by comparing it to a more extreme action, thereby implying that the original action is less problematic. this is a fallacy because the magnitude of wrongdoing does not justify or excuse the initial action, and the two situations being compared may be fundamentally different in terms of context, intent, or consequences.",False

232,"Earlier this month, NASA scientists provided a visualization of a startling climate change trend — the Earth is getting greener, as viewed from space, especially in its rapidly warming northern regions.

233,A sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity. People have become more sedentary in the last few decades. The rise in obesity can be fixed by people getting more exercise.,causal oversimplification,"answer: fallacy of causality (or causal oversimplification)
explanation: while it is true that a sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity, and it has become more common in recent decades, the rise in obesity cannot be ""fixed"" simply by people getting more exercise. other factors such as diet, genetics, age, and metabolism also play significant roles in obesity. the argument oversimplifies the complexity of the issue by suggesting that a single solution (increased exercise) can resolve the problem of rising obesity.",True
234,Smoking has been empirically proven to cause lung cancer. If we eradicate smoking we will eradicate lung cancer.,causal oversimplification,"'answer: false cause'

explanation: the argument infers that since smoking causes lung cancer, eradicating smoking would eradicate lung cancer. however, it fails to consider other possible causes of lung cancer or potential consequences of eradicating smoking (such as increased use of alternative tobacco products). therefore, the conclusion is not necessarily true based on the premise provided.",False

240,Look at the government spending money left and right like there's no tomorrow. Of course the economy's in the gutter. It's overspending 101.,causal oversimplification,"answer: false cause (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc)
explanation: the statement infers that the government spending money is causing the economy to be in a bad state, but it does not provide any evidence or reason for this claim. it simply assumes that because one event happened before another, the first event caused the second. however, there may be other factors at play that have contributed to the current state of the economy.",False

242,Globalization is killing off our industries. We used to be self-sufficient but now everything's made overseas. No wonder people are losing their jobs left and right.,causal oversimplification,"'answer: circular reasoning'
explanation: the argument relies on the premise that globalization is responsible for job losses (the conclusion), and then uses the fact of job losses as evidence for globalization being responsible, creating a circular logic where no useful information is shared to support the conclusion.",False

245,You see what happens when we lose our faith? Moral decay sets in. We need to get back to our roots and restore some order.,causal oversimplification,"answer: argument from consequences (slippery slope fallacy)

explanation: the argument asserts that the loss of faith leads to moral decay, but it does not provide any direct evidence or logical connection to prove this claim. instead, it suggests a potential consequence without demonstrating that it is inevitable or directly caused by losing faith. by doing so, it employs a slippery slope fallacy, which argues that one event will inevitably lead to a chain of events resulting in some undesirable outcome. however, in this case, the argument does not provide enough evidence to support the claim that moral decay is an inevitable consequence of losing faith.",False
246,Fast food is the devil's work. Kids these days are hooked on burgers and fries and that's why we're seeing so many chubby youngsters.,causal oversimplification,answer: false cause,False
247,Thank goodness for law enforcement cracking down. Crime rates are dropping because the cops are finally doing their job and putting criminals behind bars.,causal oversimplification,"'answer: correlation does not imply causation'

explanation: the statement assumes that the decrease in crime rates is caused by the increased activity of law enforcement, when it might just be a coincidence or there could be other factors contributing to this trend. it overlooks the possibility that there could be multiple causes for the observed phenomenon (in this case, the decrease in crime rate), and it incorrectly attributes the causality to only one factor - the increased activity of law enforcement.",False

252,The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. That's why depression rates are through the roof. It's inequality plain and simple.,causal oversimplification,"answer: false cause (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc)
explanation: the statement suggests that the increased wealth gap causes depression, but it does not provide evidence showing that this is a direct relationship between the two. there may be other factors that contribute to both the wealth gap and depression rates, such as economic instability or mental health resources. additionally, correlation does not imply causation, so it's possible that there are multiple variables at play here, rather than one causing the other.",False
253,Terrorism is a direct result of extremist ideologies. They brainwash vulnerable individuals and that's why we're seeing more attacks.,causal oversimplification,answer: nothing (this statement does not seem to contain a clear fallacy based on the information provided.),False
254,Families are falling apart because we've abandoned traditional values. Once upon a time marriage meant something but now it's just a joke.,causal oversimplification,answer: appeal to tradition,False
255,COVID-19 vaccines are the cause of new variants emerging. If we stop vaccinating we'll stop new strains from developing.,causal oversimplification,answer: false cause,False
256,The rise in COVID-19 cases is solely due to people not wearing masks. If everyone just wore masks all the time the pandemic would be over.,causal oversimplification,"answer: false cause fallacy
explanation: the conclusion (if everyone just wore masks all the time the pandemic would be over) does not logically follow from the premise (the rise in covid-19 cases is solely due to people not wearing masks). there are many factors that can influence the spread of a virus, and it's oversimplification to say that just one factor, such as mask wearing, would result in the end of a pandemic.",False
257,The increase in global temperatures is solely caused by human activity particularly the use of fossil fuels. If we just switch to renewable energy sources we can solve the problem entirely.,causal oversimplification,"'answer: false cause'
explanation: the argument assumes that the sole increase in global temperatures is due to human activity, particularly the use of fossil fuels. however, there are numerous factors affecting global temperatures and attributing it solely to one factor (human activity) is a fallacy of false causation. furthermore, it is also claimed that switching to renewable energy sources will solve the problem entirely, which ignores other contributing factors to climate change and oversimplifies the issue, making another instance of a false cause fallacy.",False
258,Global warming is primarily caused by deforestation. If we stop cutting down trees we can reverse climate change and restore balance to the planet.,causal oversimplification,answer: false cause fallacy,False
259,Extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts are directly caused by global warming. If we reduce carbon emissions we can prevent these disasters from occurring.,causal oversimplification,answer: appeal to consequence,False
260,The decline in biodiversity is solely due to global warming. If we address climate change we can protect species from extinction and restore ecological balance.,causal oversimplification,"the reasoning provided doesn't necessarily follow a defined fallacy pattern as described in the statement. it presents an argument about the impact of global warming on biodiversity, suggesting that addressing climate change could help protect species and restore ecological balance. however, no specific logical fallacy can be identified based on the information given.

if we were to make an assumption about how this process might work according to the statement, here's a possible step-by-step breakdown:

1. premise: global warming is causing a decline in biodiversity (shared by all experts)
2. conclusion: addressing climate change will protect species and restore ecological balance (all experts agree at this point)
3. no expert realizes they are wrong or leaves the process, so they all come to a final agreement.

answer: answer: nothing (no specific fallacy identified in the reasoning provided according to the statement's guidelines)",False

270,It should be okay to destroy property when you are angry because angry people destroy things.,circular reasoning,"answer: fallacy of causality. the statement assumes that being angry directly causes a person to destroy property, which may not always be the case. while anger might contribute to such actions, there are many other factors involved.",False
271,You have to save enough money to pay your bills each month because bills have to be paid.,circular reasoning,"the statement provided does not contain a clear example of a fallacy in the specified format, so the answer is 'answer: nothing'. however, it could be argued that if the assumption is made that everyone must agree on the final answer for this hypothetical scenario to work, then it could be considered a fallacy of unanimity, where a conclusion is drawn because all (or most) members of a group agree on it, and no other reasonable alternatives have been explored. but given the way the statement is presented, it doesn't explicitly meet the criteria for that fallacy either.",False

280,This novel is a masterpiece because it is an excellent book.,circular reasoning,"answer: nothing (as per the given instructions, this does not appear to be a fallacy)",False
281,The workout program is the best because it produces the best results.,circular reasoning,"the reasoning presented here does not necessarily follow a fallacy pattern, as the steps of thinking are not explicitly stated and the process described is not a typical argument structure. however, if we were to analyze it based on the general principles of an argument, one could argue that there might be an assumption being made, i.e., assuming that all experts will agree with each other's reasoning. this is because the statement ""the experts must come to a final agreement"" implies that there is no room for disagreement, which can limit the diversity and thoroughness of thought in the process. therefore, one could say that it might contain an element of 'appeal to consensus' (the idea that if most people believe something, then it must be true), though not explicitly stated as such.

answer: answer: possible appeal to consensus (if we were to analyze based on general principles)",False
282,The judge is just and fair because he sets the innocent free and punishes the guilty.,circular reasoning,"answer: hasty generalization
explanation: the reasoning behind this statement assumes that because a judge sets an innocent person free, they are automatically just and fair. however, it is possible that the judge may have made a mistake in freeing the innocent person, or that there were extenuating circumstances involved in the case. furthermore, setting an innocent person free does not necessarily mean that the judge is also punishing the guilty, as there may be other cases pending or evidence yet to be discovered. therefore, this statement is making a hasty generalization about the character of the judge based on a single action.",False

295,"You say we should be kind to others, but you yelled at a cashier.",tu quoque,"answer: inconsistency or tu quoque (depending on the interpretation)

explanation: the argument is that because the speaker claims one should be kind to others, yet they themselves did something unkind (yelled at a cashier), this makes their claim hypocritical and invalid. however, it could also be seen as an inconsistency fallacy if the unkind action doesn't directly contradict the claim of kindness towards others, but rather shows a personal failure to live up to that claim. in either case, the argument is flawed by pointing out that the one making the argument is not acting consistently with their claims.",True

319,Sure philosophy helps you argue better but do we really need to encourage people to argue? There's enough hostility in this world.,equivocation,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents only two options, ""arguing"" and ""not arguing"", while the reality is that there are many shades of argumentation, from constructive debate to destructive bickering. thus, it oversimplifies a complex issue by presenting a limited number of choices and ignoring other possibilities.",False
320,I don't see how you can say you're an ethical person.

324,Raspberries are fruits so raspberry sherbet counts as a serving of fruit.,equivocation,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

explanation: the argument is based on the assumption that ""raspberry"" refers to the fruit in one context (the classification of raspberries as a fruit) and then, without clarifying or acknowledging this change in meaning, it is used to refer to the sherbet made from raspberries. this ambiguity makes the argument misleading. the fact that raspberries are fruits does not necessarily mean that raspberry sherbet counts as a serving of fruit.",True

326,I have the right to free speech so it’s right for me to say whatever I want.,equivocation,"answer: appeal to rights (or self-evident assumption)

explanation: the person is assuming that their right to free speech automatically makes everything they say justified or correct, without providing any further reasoning or evidence to support their statement. this is a fallacy because just having the right to do something does not necessarily make it the right thing to do in every situation.",False

332,Children should learn in classroom. Our land needs more well educated people.,equivocation,answer: fallacy of composition,False
333,"Drinking at home is also harmful, but nobody argues against drinking.",equivocation,"the statement does not provide a clear argument for a fallacy to be identified. it presents an observation about social behavior rather than an argument with premises and conclusions. therefore, the answer would be 'answer: nothing'. however, if we were to analyze it further, one possible interpretation could be that it is an example of 'appeal to ignorance' (i.e., assuming something to be true because it has not been proven false). but since this is not a structured argument, it's difficult to definitively say for sure.",False

337,We must have faith in our leaders for without faith we have no hope. Faith has led humanity through its darkest hours.,equivocation,answer: appeal to tradition,False
338,Our nation values freedom. That’s why we should have only state-run media. Government controlled media that aligns with our national values will keep our citizens free from foreign influences and disinformation.,equivocation,"answer: argument by false cause
explanation: the reasoning provided does not logically follow the conclusion drawn. freedom is a value, while having state-run media is not directly related to maintaining freedom or preventing foreign influence and disinformation. instead, it might lead to censorship and lack of diversity in viewpoints. this fallacy occurs when an incorrect cause is assumed to be responsible for the effect being observed.",False
339,My priority is stabilizing the city’s economy. That’s why implementing rent-stabilized housing will be my first action in office.,equivocation,"the reasoning provided does not show a clear fallacy, as it presents a reason (stabilizing the city's economy) for an intended action (implementing rent-stabilized housing), without introducing additional fallacies in the description. however, the statement could potentially be subject to the following fallacy:

answer: appeal to consequences (if the reasoning implies that the proposed action will inevitably lead to stabilizing the city's economy)",False
340,With the economy being so unpredictable they say it’s important to choose solid investments. That’s why I'm going for tangible assets like gold and silver. At the end of the day I’ll be left with something solid that I can hold in my hands.,equivocation,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, 'appeal to security')",False

345,The sign said 'fine for parking here' so I parked here and now I have to pay a fine.,equivocation,"answer: false cause

explanation: the person assumed that the sign was intended as a suggestion, but it was actually a rule or regulation. therefore, they mistakenly concluded (caused) that since they obeyed the sign, they should not have been fined. however, this assumption is incorrect because the meaning of the sign is not based on their interpretation, but on its actual intention.",False

349,"The United States is the richest country in the world. Therefore, everyone in the United States must be rich and live well.",fallacy of division,"answer: fallacy of composition
explanation: the statement assumes that what is true for a whole (the united states) is also true for each part of it (everyone living there). this is incorrect because it overlooks the fact that not everyone in the u.s. may be rich, as wealth distribution can vary significantly within a country.",False
350,"Because professional sports players are paid outrageous salaries, every professional sports player must be rich",fallacy of division,"answer: false dilemma (or equivocation, depending on the interpretation of ""rich"")

explanation: the fallacy lies in the assumption that because all professional sports players are paid high salaries, they must all be wealthy. this is a fallacy of equivocation if ""rich"" means having an abundance of money beyond what is needed for one's lifestyle or essential expenses, as many athletes might still spend their earnings quickly and may not have savings. the false dilemma comes in because the argument suggests that being a professional athlete only leads to wealth (one extreme) or poverty (the other extreme), when there can be various levels of financial stability in between.",False
351,"Australian people are good at surfing. Matt is Australian. Therefore, Matt is good at surfing",fallacy of division,answer: fallacy of undistributed middle,False
352,"Houses are made of atoms, and houses are visible. Therefore, atoms must be visible.",fallacy of division,answer: fallacy of composition,False
353,"Matt must be happy - I think this because he is Finnish, and Finland is the happiest country in the world",fallacy of division,"answer: fallacy of hasty generalization. the reasoning here is based on a single characteristic (being from finland) and incorrectly applies it to all individuals of that group (finns are always happy). it disregards other factors that may influence an individual's happiness, such as personal circumstances or experiences.",False
354,"Given Google’s track record of groundbreaking technology, it’s safe to assume that any new product from Google is destined to become a fundamental part of our daily lives.",fallacy of division,"answer: appeal to authority (specifically, an unstated or implied authority)

explanation: the argument relies on the assumption that because google has a ""track record of groundbreaking technology,"" any new product they release will automatically be a significant and essential part of people's daily lives. however, this assumption is not supported by evidence or reasoning - it merely asserts that google's authority extends to future products without providing justification for why that would be the case. it is a fallacy because it presumes that one successful aspect (in this case, past technological breakthroughs) of an entity automatically grants them authority across all areas (future product success).",False
355,"Ancient Greece was a cradle of philosophy, producing great thinkers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. This suggests that every individual in Ancient Greece must have been deeply philosophical and engaged in high-level intellectual activities.",fallacy of division,"answer: false dilemma
explanation: the statement assumes that everyone in ancient greece was either a philosopher or not a philosopher, but the reality is likely more complex - some may have been philosophers, while others were farmers, craftsmen, soldiers, etc. thus, it oversimplifies the situation by presenting only two extremes when more options exist.",False
356,"Overall, the food in our lunchroom is healthy and receives high ratings from the health department. So, the chocolate chip cookies that they are serving must be healthy for me!",fallacy of division,"answer: fallacy of relevance
explanation: the reasoning here is flawed because not all parts of a whole have the same characteristics. just because the overall food in the lunchroom is healthy and receives high ratings from the health department, it does not mean that all individual foods served are healthy as well, especially when those specific foods (like chocolate chip cookies) have different nutritional values compared to other foods.",False

359,"The boys in my neighborhood like to play basketball after school. So my new neighbor, Kevin, will like to play basketball with them.",fallacy of division,"answer: fallacy of undistributed middle (or affirming the consequent)
explanation: the conclusion that ""kevin will like to play basketball with them"" is based on the premise ""the boys in my neighborhood like to play basketball after school"". however, there's no reason to assume that kevin shares this common interest. we can only deduce that if we know that all boys in the neighborhood like to play basketball and kevin is a boy in the neighborhood, then it would be reasonable to expect him to also like to play basketball. but without additional information about kevin, the conclusion is not justified.",False
360,"I just read a report about teachers not being happy with how much they are paid. So, my Aunt Sarah who is a teacher must be unhappy with her salary.",fallacy of division,answer: fallacy of hasty generalization,False
361,"The universe has existed for fifteen billion years. The universe is made out of molecules. Therefore, each of the molecules in the universe has existed for fifteen billion years.",fallacy of division,answer: fallacy of division,True
362,"In the Holy Church, all priests must be Holy.",fallacy of division,answer: false dilemma,False
363,"His house is about half the size of most houses in the neighborhood. Therefore, his doors must all be about 3 1/2 feet high.",fallacy of division,answer: fallacy of division,True
364,"I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up.  Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!",fallacy of division,answer: guilt by association,False
365,"Healthy brains think. Healthy brains are comprised of nothing but brain cells. If healthy brains think, then the individual brain cells can think too.",fallacy of division,answer: fallacy of composition,False
366,"Renewables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.",false analogy,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, 'appeal to negative emotion')",False
367,"Like countless other organisms, we move and adapt when the environment changes. Species thrive when it is warm.",false analogy,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents a binary choice (move and adapt or do not move and adapt) when in reality, there are many possible responses to environmental change. it oversimplifies the spectrum of potential choices available to species.",False
368,"You’ve only got to look at Singapore. It’s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change, and it’s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in.",false analogy,"answer: hasty generalization

explanation: the argument is making a broad claim about all of singapore based on a single example. while singapore may be an extreme case, it does not necessarily mean that all cities experiencing climate change will follow the same pattern. additionally, desirability as a city to live in might not be related to the impact of climate change.",False
369,"Venus, which was once a very Earth-like planet with plenty of life-supporting water before runaway climate change rapidly transformed it into an arid and uninhabitable sphere enveloped in an unbreathable gas.",false analogy,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

explanation: the term ""venus"" is used in two different ways here, first as a celestial body, and second as a metaphor for something that has undergone drastic change. this ambiguity creates a misleading argument where the same term is being applied in two distinctly different contexts, which can be confusing and lead to fallacies.",False
370,"They do know that in acid waters, oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells, and that when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans’ pH has over the past generation, it induces seizures, comas, and sudden death.",false analogy,answer: nothing,False
371,"Renewables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.",false analogy,"answer: false cause
explanation: the statement presents multiple effects (pollution, killing birds and bats, killing insects, creating health problems, leaving toxins, despoiling the landscape) as causes of the argument that renewables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous. however, these effects do not logically imply the stated cause. therefore, it is a fallacy where an event or condition is incorrectly asserted as being causally related to another event or condition.",False
372,"Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red.

374,"No one objects to a physician looking up a difficult case in medical books. Why, then, shouldn't students taking a difficult examination be permitted to use their textbooks?",false analogy,"answer: false analogy
explanation: the argument is making an analogy between the act of a physician consulting medical books and that of a student using textbooks during an examination. however, the two situations are not similar enough for this analogy to hold true. in one scenario (a physician), consulting books to understand complex medical cases is reasonable, while in the other scenario (a student), using textbooks during an examination to find answers is cheating and not allowed. thus, it is a false analogy because it draws a comparison between two unlike situations to reach a conclusion that does not hold.",True

376,"If somebody has a cure for cancer, would you reject it because it was somebody you may not like who came up with it?",false analogy,"answer: nothing (there is no fallacy in this statement as it does not present an argument, but rather a hypothetical question.)",False
377,To say humans are immortal is like saying a car can run forever.,false analogy,answer: analogy fallacy,False
378,Making people register their own guns is like the Nazis making the Jews register with their government. This policy is crazy.,false analogy,answer: false analogy,True
379,"If one were to listen to only one kind of music or eat only one kind of food, it would soon become tasteless or boring. Variety makes eating and listening exciting and enriching experiences. So it seems to me that an exclusive sexual relationship with only one partner for the rest of ones life, that is, marriage, does not hold out much hope for very much excitement or enrichment.",false analogy,"'answer: appeal to emotion'
explanation: the argument uses the emotions (excitement and enrichment) to make the conclusion (marriage not being exciting or enriching) seem reasonable without giving substantial evidence in favor of it.",False
380,"Smoking cigarettes is just like ingesting arsenic into your system. Both have been shown to be causally related to death. So if you wouldn't want to take a spoonful of arsenic, I would think that you wouldn't want to continue smoking.",false analogy,answer: false analogy,True

387,"Maintaining a healthy diet is like maintaining a well-oiled machine. Just as machines need regular oil changes to run smoothly, humans need consistent diets to function properly.",false analogy,"the statement given is not a fallacy in the given context. it is a metaphor or analogy that compares maintaining a healthy diet with maintaining a well-oiled machine. however, if we were to find a fallacy within this statement, it could be an 'appeal to anecdote' if someone were to use this metaphor as evidence in an argument without providing any further supporting evidence. but the statement itself doesn't inherently contain that fallacy.

388,Implementing strict immigration policies is like securing your home with high fences and locks. Both keep out unwanted intruders and protect what's inside.,false analogy,answer: false analogy,True
389,Requiring vaccinations for schoolchildren is like forcing everyone to wear seat belts. Both infringe on personal freedoms under the guise of safety.,false analogy,"'answer: false analogy'
explanation: the argument here makes a comparison between two different situations, requiring vaccinations for schoolchildren and wearing seat belts, that are not analogous. while both may involve restrictions on personal freedom in the name of safety, the consequences, benefits, and justifications for each are fundamentally different. requiring vaccinations helps protect public health by reducing the spread of contagious diseases, while requiring seat belts primarily aims to protect individuals from injury or death in a car accident. therefore, this argument is a false analogy because it incorrectly equates two situations that are not substantively similar.",True
390,"Social media platforms are like public parks. If we regulate speech on social media, it’s the same as regulating conversations in public parks.",false analogy,"answer: false analogy

explanation: while there might be some similarities between social media platforms and public parks (such as being open to the public), the differences far outweigh any potential similarities. regulating speech on social media involves complex algorithms, privacy concerns, and business models that are not present in a public park. therefore, using ""public parks"" as an example to support the idea that regulating speech on social media is a problematic comparison because they are fundamentally different concepts.",True
391,Learning a new language as an adult is like learning to walk again after an injury. Both are nearly impossible without constant practice and patience.,false analogy,"answer: false analogy
explanation: while both learning a new language as an adult and learning to walk again after an injury may require constant practice and patience, they are fundamentally different activities with distinct challenges. the two processes do not share enough commonalities to justify drawing a direct comparison between them as the argument does.",True
392,Allowing employees to work from home permanently is like allowing them to take a permanent vacation. Both will lead to a drop in productivity and accountability.,false analogy,answer: false analogy,True

explanation: the person's belief that sleeping with one's shoes on causes a headache is based on their personal experience, but it does not necessarily mean that wearing shoes while sleeping is the actual cause of the headaches. other factors such as sleep position, temperature, or other environmental conditions could be the real cause of the headaches.",False

412,Extreme weather-related deaths in the U.S. have decreased by more than 98% over the last 100 years... Global warming saves lives.,false causality,"answer: false cause

explanation: the statement is making a claim that global warming causes a decrease in extreme weather-related deaths, but it does not provide a valid explanation for why this might be the case. it could be that there are many other factors contributing to the decrease in deaths or that the trend observed may have happened independently of global warming. the statement is using a single observation (the trend in death rates) as evidence for a cause-effect relationship, without providing any supporting evidence or analysis to demonstrate that this relationship actually exists.",False
413,Every severe recession follows a Republican Presidency; therefore Republicans are the cause of recessions.,false causality,answer: fallacy of causal oversimplification or hasty generalization,False
414,“But like most claims regarding global warming the real effect is small and most likely due to natural weather patterns. Any changes in hurricanes over 70 years can easily be part of natural cycles — or incomplete data. Coastal lake sediments along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from 1000 to 2000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today.,false causality,"answer: appeal to nature
explanation: the argument suggests that because the observed changes (increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes) might have occurred in the past, they are therefore part of natural cycles or due to incomplete data, thus dismissing the claim of global warming. this is a fallacy known as appeal to nature, where an observation or fact about nature is used to support an unrelated argument, rather than providing evidence that directly supports the argument. in this case, the argument does not provide evidence that the observed changes are due to natural cycles or incomplete data, only that such changes have occurred in the past, which might be consistent with either scenario.",False

416,The purpose of this operation is to protect people who have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kiev regime.,false causality,"answer: nothing. the statement does not present a fallacy as it merely describes a process without making any argument or claiming anything as true, false, or justified based on flawed reasoning. it seems more like a hypothetical scenario or a description of a procedure rather than an instance of a fallacy.",False

419,The occurrence of natural disasters coincides with military exercises or operations in certain regions. These disasters must be caused by covert military actions.,false causality,answer: fallacy of false cause,False
420,The presence of unusual weather patterns correlates with sightings of unidentified flying objects. These UFOs must be manipulating the weather.,false causality,answer: false cause,False
421,After the introduction of genetically modified foods there was an increase in reported cases of cancer. GMOs must be causing cancer.,false causality,answer: correlation does not imply causation,False
422,The discovery of ancient artifacts coincides with mysterious disappearances or accidents. Therefore these artifacts must be cursed or possessed.,false causality,answer: appeal to superstition,False
423,"I would never hurt a puppy nor ask anyone else to. Pets are not used in animal testing. Again, would you save a diseased rat over yourself?",false dilemma,"answer: equivocation

the argument equivocates on the term ""pets"". while the arguer initially uses it to refer to companion animals (like dogs and cats), they later use it to imply all domesticated animals, which includes laboratory rats. this shift in meaning without making it explicit can make the argument seem more reasonable or persuasive than it actually is.",False

433,"Obviously great mathematicians are born, and not made. John had all the best opportunities and is only mediocre at math. But Kara was good at math from the beginning.",false dilemma,"'answer: fallacy of hasty generalization'
explanation: the argument infers that because two individuals (john and kara) have different outcomes in terms of their mathematical abilities, it can be concluded that being born, rather than opportunities, is the determinant factor for mathematical talent. however, this conclusion is based on only two cases and thus overgeneralizes the relationship between being born versus opportunities and mathematical talent.",False
434,"On the quad, I see the jocks in one corner, the rebels in another, and the intellectual set in yet another. Which one of these groups do you hang out with?",false dilemma,"answer: false dilemma. explanation: the statement presents only three options (jocks, rebels, or intellectuals) when there may be other groups on the quad, making it a fallacy of false dilemma by limiting the number of choices to two extremes or categories when more exist.",True
435,"You ask how I can know that you're struggling financially?  It's simple: in a capitalist economy, you either win big or you lose big, and I know you're not one of the big winners.",false dilemma,answer: fallacy of hasty generalization,False

439,"If we want to make campus safer, we can either install more security cameras or ban visitors.",false dilemma,"the reasoning presented does not necessarily follow a fallacy pattern as described in the scenario. instead, it presents two possible solutions (installing more security cameras or banning visitors) without explicitly stating that only these two options exist. however, the statement could be viewed as a restricted alternative (also known as false dilemma), but only if additional context suggests that these are indeed the only alternatives being considered and no other options are being entertained. in the absence of such context, it's hard to definitively classify this reasoning as a fallacy.

answer: answer: restricted alternative (potentially)",True
440,“You either support all government policies or you leave the country.”,false dilemma,answer: false dilemma,True
441,"Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.",false dilemma,answer: false dilemma,True

449,School detention in high school means more school and less freetime. Less freetime lead to severe psychological problems for a schoolmate of mine. Therefore it does not do any good.,hasty generalization,answer: fallacy of causality,False
450,"A global task force to stop Ebola solved the issue, so this environment task force will do its job, too.",hasty generalization,"answer: fallacy of false cause (also known as affirming the consequent)
explanation: the statement suggests that since one problem was solved by a certain method (the global task force solving ebola), another problem can be solved using the same method (the environment task force solving its job). however, it is not logically sound to conclude that just because one situation had a certain outcome, the same situation will have the same outcome in another context.",False
451,Christiano Ronaldo played so bad in 2014. He cannot be the best in 2016.,hasty generalization,answer: false dilemma,False
452,My sister is only watching TV and talks less than earlier. TV is bad for communication among family-members.,hasty generalization,"answer: fallacy of causality (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc)
explanation: the statement assumes that because the sister started watching more tv, she now talks less; however, it does not take into account other possible factors that might be influencing her behavior, such as being tired or busy. therefore, it is a fallacy where a cause and effect relationship is incorrectly inferred between two events (watching tv and talking less) when there may be no actual causal relationship.",False

455,I dont know a healthy person that wants to suicide. No healthy person wants this.,hasty generalization,"'answer: fallacy of false cause'
explanation: the argument assumes that being healthy is the only reason why someone would not want to commit suicide, which is not true. mental health plays an important role in the decision to commit suicide, and many people with mental illness can be physically healthy. furthermore, the argument makes a causal connection between physical health and the desire for life, but such a connection does not exist.",False

459,Temelin exploded. It is never ok to use it.,hasty generalization,"'answer: fallacy of hasty generalization'
explanation: the reasoning seems to be that if three different experts all reach a certain step, then they will all reach the final agreement. however, this is an oversimplification and overgeneralization based on limited evidence (just three experts). there is no reason to assume that the remaining experts would also agree with the initial three.",True
460,"Yes, because we were attacked, and if we don't go to war we will be attacked again.",hasty generalization,answer: false dilemma,False
461,There do exist local environment task forces. They all do a good job. Therefore a global environment task force has to be good as well.,hasty generalization,answer: fallacy of composition,False

465,"Facebook cost me just time, a lot of time! It is bad for all others as well and bad for society.",hasty generalization,"answer: false cause
explanation: the argument claims that facebook causes wasting time and being bad for society without providing any evidence or reason supporting this claim. instead, it makes a negative assertion based on the assumption that because the arguer feels that facebook is harmful, it must be so for others as well. this is a fallacy of causality where the correlation between the cause (facebook) and effect (wasting time, harm to society) is not demonstrated or supported by evidence.",False

470,I always wait until the last minute to complete my assignments and I’m still passing all my classes. There’s nothing wrong with procrastinating and putting off your assignments.,hasty generalization,"answer: fallacy of hasty generalization

explanation: the statement suggests that because the arguer is passing all their classes while procrastinating, it implies that there's nothing wrong with procrastinating when completing assignments. however, this conclusion is based on a single example, which may not be representative of the larger population or the long-term effects of procrastination. therefore, it is a fallacy where a generalization is made based on a limited number of examples or instances.",True
471,"I knew this one guy who had plastic surgery to reconstruct his ear after an accident, and it was a huge success. It was good for him, so it is an important field of medicine.",hasty generalization,"answer: equivocation

explanation: the argument uses the term ""success"" in two different ways. first, it refers to the successful reconstruction of the ear after an accident. second, it implies that because this one specific example was good for the person, the entire field of plastic surgery for ear reconstruction should be considered important. however, success in one instance does not mean that every instance will result in success or that the field as a whole is important. this is equivocation because the term ""success"" has been given two different meanings within the argument.",False
472,"Yes, whoever drinks and drives has a bad reaction time. People might die.",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
473,Of course same-sex marriage should be allowed.,nothing,"the reasoning presented is not a direct logical argument, but rather a description of a hypothetical scenario. therefore, it does not fall under the common categories of logical fallacies as described in this context. instead, we could say that the scenario lacks the necessary structure to identify a specific fallacy.

however, if we interpret the statement as an argument that same-sex marriage should be allowed because it is the most equitable and fair way to treat all individuals under the law, then one might argue that the appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion) could be present, as the argument is trying to make the conclusion seem reasonable by appealing to the position of fairness and equity. but, this interpretation goes beyond the description provided for the statement.

answer: 'answer: possible appeal to positive emotion' (this interpretation may not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the scenario as described)",False
474,We shouldn't allow men to oppress women.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma. explanation: the statement suggests that all men oppress women, which is a fallacy because it presents only two extreme choices (oppressor or not) when there are many shades of behavior and attitudes towards gender that exist between these extremes.",False
475,Good point. Why not.,nothing,answer: nothing,True
476,Just a test argument.,nothing,answer: nothing,True
477,"Yes, they do make schools more effective.",nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
478,Better testing new medical products on animals than on humans.,nothing,"answer: false analogy

explanation: the statement is making a comparison (better) between two situations that are not truly analogous. testing medical products on animals and testing them on humans serves different purposes and has different ethical implications. therefore, the claim that one is better than the other because they are different does not hold.",False
479,We as the country cannot afford that.,nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
480,"Yes, the Islamic state is becoming too big to fight without military operations.",nothing,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the argument presents only two options (fighting the islamic state with military operations or not fighting it at all) and implies that there are no other possibilities. however, there may be alternative solutions to the problem, such as diplomatic negotiations, economic sanctions, or supporting local forces against the islamic state without directly engaging in military operations. therefore, the argument is a fallacy of false dilemma by limiting the options presented and ignoring possible alternatives.",False
481,Yes they allow us to connect.,nothing,answer: false dilemma,False

484,"Yes, the man has been on the moon.",nothing,answer: nothing (there is no identified fallacy in this statement.),True
485,I don't think school uniforms can influence the pupils' performance.,nothing,"answer: nothing. the statement does not contain a fallacy, it is just an opinion. however, if the argument were to be made in a debate or discussion, and someone else was to respond with ""you must be wrong because you are not a teacher"" (appeal to authority), that would introduce a fallacy. but as presented, there is no fallacy.",True
486,"Yes, the man has been on the moon.",nothing,answer: nothing (it does not provide enough information to determine if it is a fallacy),True
487,Children should go to regular schools.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma
explanation: the scenario describes a situation where three experts are asked to come to a final agreement, and if any of them realize they are wrong at any point, they leave. this is not necessarily a fallacy by definition but it does present a limited number of options (the remaining experts agreeing) and potentially pressures the experts into conformity, thus ignoring other possible choices or alternatives that might exist.",False
488,"I own a computer-factory. And I'm outsourcing my support-callcenter to India. I don't want those people to work like animals. I pay less money than in Germany, yes, but it is still a lot of money for the workers there.",nothing,answer: appeal to sympathy,False

492,We might not want to home school all children because it is important for them to learn how to interact with others.,nothing,"answer: nothing (or possibly circular reasoning, depending on interpretation)

the statement does not explicitly present a fallacy in the format described above. while it could potentially be argued as circular reasoning if the premise for not homeschooling all children is that they need to learn how to interact with others, and the conclusion being that we don't want to homeschool them because they need to learn how to interact with others, this interpretation would require some assumptions. in reality, the statement is simply presenting an argument against homeschooling based on its potential impact on socialization skills.",True
493,I do not think so because there is always the danger that the normal child might bully the handicapped one because of their mental weakness.,nothing,answer: false dichotomy,False
494,I regard single-sex education as bad.,nothing,"answer: nothing (since it does not present a specific fallacy, but rather a statement of personal opinion)",True
495,I think society in general benefits from social networks.,nothing,"answer: answer: nothing (as described, it doesn't provide a specific fallacy). however, this statement could potentially be classified as an example of an argumentum ad populum if the implicit assumption is that because many people benefit from social networks, it must automatically be true for everyone and in every context.",True
496,"For first steps in basic research, animal testing for medical reasons is more efficient than human testing.",nothing,answer: false analogy,False

499,The information in social networks is often not reliable.,nothing,"answer: fallacy of hasty generalization
explanation: the reasoning goes like this: ""all social network posts are from unreliable sources"" (generalization). however, there might be cases where the posts are indeed reliable but because they are a minority, it's incorrect to assume that all social networks posts are not reliable.",False
500,"I am a mother of 3 children and my body is not perfect anymore. But I don't care, because all people are pretty, no matter what their body looks like.",nothing,answer: nothing (no fallacy is present in the statement as it does not present an argument or claim.),True
501,Neuer was the best goalkeeper of the World Cup in 2014 because he made the most saves.,nothing,answer: fallacy of hasty generalization,False
502,"Yes. Although many forms of plastic surgery can be used for superficial reasons, it is important because it is also used to reconstruct things for people after bad accidents, or for gender reassignment, skin grafts from burns, etc.",nothing,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents two reasons for plastic surgery (superficial and reconstruction/medical) as if they are the only possibilities, implying that superficial reasons are invalid because they don't fit into the ""reconstruction/medical"" category. however, there may be other valid reasons for getting plastic surgery that are not mentioned in the statement.",False

505,It is not as effective as it could be. Many students can suffer due to ineffective policies.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma
explanation: the statement suggests that the only two possible outcomes of this method are either a final agreement or some students suffering due to ineffective policies. however, there might be other possibilities such as disagreement leading to further discussion and refinement of ideas, which could potentially lead to improved policies rather than causing suffering.",False
506,Communication between family members suffers from watching TV.,nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False

508,Gorillas should live freely in nature.,nothing,"answer: nothing (as per the given conditions, the statement does not meet the requirements to be classified as a fallacy)",True
509,Endless growth is impossible.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the scenario presented suggests that there are only two possible outcomes: the experts come to a final agreement or one of them leaves. however, it is possible for other scenarios to occur, such as the experts continuing to disagree and not coming to an agreement without one leaving, or the group reaching an impasse where no one leaves but also does not agree. therefore, more than two possibilities exist, and the scenario presents a fallacious false dilemma by suggesting that there are only two options when there are in fact more.",False
510,"I really felt if I had stayed in single-sex, I would have been unprepared for life after high school, socially speaking.",nothing,answer: argument from ignorance,False
511,Non-European immigrants should be accepted in Europe.,nothing,"answer: appeal to fairness (or ""appeal to fairness and reciprocity"")

explanation: the statement presents the idea that because non-europeans have welcomed european immigrants, it is now europe's turn to reciprocate by accepting immigrants from other continents. however, this argument assumes a sense of fairness or reciprocity between different groups without providing any evidence or reasoning to support it. it does not necessarily mean that the statement is wrong or untrue, but rather that the argument relies on emotions (fairness and reciprocity) instead of objective evidence.",False
512,"I don’t think school children should spend as much time as they usually do isolated by age, let alone sex.",nothing,"the reasoning provided does not describe a clear fallacy. it is more of an argument for changing educational policies rather than a logical fallacy. if we were to categorize it, it might be considered an 'appeal to emotion' if the main reason behind changing current practices is based on empathy towards children, rather than hard evidence or facts. however, this interpretation depends on how the actual argument unfolds in practice. so, answer: 'answer: possibly appeal to emotion'.",False
513,"People are not being abused. Many new companies operate in other countries for fair wages, offering opportunities that they would not otherwise have. At the same time, American citizens benefit by manufacturing efficiency and not driving American business further into debt.",nothing,"answer: false dilemma (explanation: the statement presents two choices - either the workers are being abused or they have better opportunities than they would without these companies. however, there may exist other possibilities such as fair wages without abuse or exploitation, which is not considered in this argument.)",False
514,"Yes, there's is no way that they could fake such an event. There is a lot proof, such as video footage and rocks brought back that could not be faked.",nothing,"answer: appeal to authority (the claim relies on the alleged expertise of the experts, but it does not provide any evidence or reason for their supposed authority in this specific context)",False
515,"I really felt if I had stayed in single-sex, I would have been unprepared for life after high school, socially speaking.",nothing,"answer: false cause (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc)
explanation: the student suggests that staying in a single-sex environment during high school directly led to their lack of preparedness for life after high school, socially speaking. however, this argument assumes causality without providing evidence to support it. it is possible that other factors contributed to the student's social difficulties. in this case, staying in a single-sex environment may have been a factor, but it does not necessarily mean it was the primary cause of their struggles.",False
516,"Terror has proven itself to be a real and unignorable danger, thus something has to be done.",nothing,"'answer: false dilemma'
explanation: the statement presents two options (terror exists or ignore terror) while ignoring other possible options that exist between these extremes such as addressing the root causes of terrorism, increasing security measures, diplomatic efforts, etc. thus, it is a fallacy where only two choices are presented yet more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes.",False
517,The reason for the supporters of the war on terror is 9/11.,nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
518,The Islamist terrorists are a serious threat to each form of progressive society.,nothing,answer: nothing (this statement does not contain a fallacy as described in the scenario),True
519,"With the goal in mind to improve everyone's situation, growth is good for a country.",nothing,answer: fallacy of assumption,False
520,People have been on the moon already.,nothing,"'answer: circular reasoning'
explanation: the argument is based on the premise that experts must agree on a final answer, which implies that the experts are an authority on the matter. however, the claim that people have been on the moon already is the very thing the experts are supposed to agree upon, making it a circular argument where the conclusion supports the premise and vice versa.",False
521,Nuclear energy is a cheap power source.,nothing,"'answer: false dilemma'
explanation: the statement presents only one positive aspect of nuclear energy (being a cheap power source) without considering other relevant factors such as safety concerns, environmental impact, or long-term waste management, which could counterbalance the cost advantage and make it a less desirable option. by overemphasizing a single benefit while ignoring potential drawbacks, the argument creates a false dilemma by presenting only two extreme positions (nuclear energy is cheap vs. nuclear energy is bad) without acknowledging a spectrum of possible choices that exist between these extremes.",False
522,School uniforms do not make school a more effective place to learn.,nothing,"answer: false cause

explanation: the statement suggests that uniforms have a direct causal effect on the effectiveness of learning in schools, which is not necessarily true. there could be many other factors contributing to the learning environment that are not related to school uniforms. therefore, it is a fallacy where a cause and effect relationship is incorrectly assumed between two things.",False
523,I highly recommend a co-ed school.,nothing,"answer: answer: nothing (this statement does not appear to be a fallacy, but rather an opinion or argument for a particular educational setup).",True
524,"Social education is important, alongside academics. The real world is not segregated, nor are universities.",nothing,answer: nothing,True
525,"High schools should provide daycare services for students who have children, because it is not legit to exclude students who have children from certain possibilities to advance in society and to cut down their freedom in educational issues in an unproportional manner.",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
526,We need drug testing to ensure fair competition.,nothing,"the reasoning provided in the statement does not present a clear argument structure, so it is difficult to definitively classify it as a fallacy. however, if we assume that the reasoning is intended to be an argument for implementing drug testing in sports competitions, then the statement seems to lack sufficient justification or evidence to support the claim. therefore, it may be argued that the statement relies on assumptions or unproven premises, which could be considered a form of an ""unproven assumption"" fallacy or a type of reasoning known as ""affirming the consequent"".

in this case, if we take the argument in the form of a conditional statement: if drug testing ensures fair competition, then we need drug testing. the conclusion follows logically from the premise, but the premise itself remains unproven. it is not clear that drug testing actually does ensure fair competition; it may do so under certain conditions, but the argument does not provide enough evidence to support this claim.

however, the structure of the reasoning provided in the statement does not strictly match any common fallacy types, as described in the initial question, because the statement does not present a false dilemma, appeal to emotions or authority, equivocation, etc. therefore, the answer would be: 'answer: -unproven assumption-'.",False
527,"Yes, global warming is a serious issue.",nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
528,There are some reasons for America's war on terror.,nothing,"the statement does not present a clear argument, and it does not contain a fallacy. however, if we were to analyze it further, we could argue that the statement implies a premise without providing any evidence or justification. this is similar to an appeal to fear, where the conclusion is based on unsubstantiated premises. but since the statement doesn't explicitly use fear as a motivator, we cannot definitively label it as an appeal to fear.

answer: nothing (but with the additional information provided, it could be argued that there is an implied fallacy of assuming unproven premises)",True
529,"They certainly could be more violent. The thing with Quentin Tarantino is that he understands the separation between real life and movies. He understands that movies are supposed to be wild and outrageous and that is exactly what his movies are known for, especially when it comes to violence.",nothing,"answer: nothing (there is no fallacy in this statement as described, since it does not present an argument, nor does it claim to represent evidence or reasoning for a conclusion.)",True
530,"They brought several kilos of moon rocks back to earth, and you cannot simply fake four billion years old rock material.",nothing,"'answer: circular reasoning'
explanation: the argument assumes that because the rocks are real (as evidenced by them being returned from the moon), they must be four billion years old without providing any additional evidence or reason for this assumption. however, the four billion year age is exactly what needs to be proven first before it can be used as evidence in the argument itself.",False
531,"Christiano Ronaldo hat viele Neider, doch er ist wohl mit Abstand der momentan beste Spieler der Welt. (Cristiano Ronaldo has many detractors, but he is probably by far the best player in the world at the moment.)",nothing,answer: nothing,True
532,It helps companies lower labor costs and increased realization of economics of scale.,nothing,answer: appeal to consequences,False
533,Microsoft is not the new apple.,nothing,answer: false analogy,False
534,Nuclear power is an incredibly reasonable power source granted it is used by people who are responsible. It's the most effective energy source in the world and incredibly clean.,nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
535,There is no denying that CO2 emissions and average temperature of the atmosphere both have gone up; there are many studies on it.,nothing,answer: nothing,True
536,People become too involved with social media and fail to make real personal connections with others.,nothing,"answer: false cause fallacy

explanation: the claim that people failing to make real personal connections with others is caused by their involvement with social media, but there is no evidence or reason provided for the claim that social media causes this problem. there may be correlations between the two, but correlation does not imply causation.",False
537,"Animals have a conscious mind. That means they deserve protection through law, like humans do. Nevertheless, they aren't as intelligent as humans, that's why they need a special law.",nothing,"'answer: fallacy of equivocation'
explanation: the fallacy occurs because the term ""conscious mind"" is used ambiguously in this argument. in one sense, it implies self-awareness and cognitive abilities. however, in another sense, it simply means to be alive and respond to stimuli. the second definition is what applies to animals. by equivocating on the meaning of conscious mind, the argument seems valid but is actually flawed.",False
538,"Current civil unrest in Turkey is partly based on resentment of other European governments. Given the governments aren't getting along, it seems like Turkey isn't ready.",nothing,answer: fallacy of guilt by association,False
539,"No, it's not worth the risk. So many people did already die because of radiation...",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
540,"If you don't allow animals to have rights, you shouldn't have them either.",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
541,We should allow animal testing for medical purposes.,nothing,answer: argument from authority (if all experts are assumed to be authoritative on the subject),False
542,Democracy is good.,nothing,answer: nothing (the reasoning steps provided do not describe a fallacy),True
543,"Refugees mostly flee from the war, poverty, or tyranny in their countries. Unless these problems are solved to some extent and they have some other safe place to reside in, except EU, they should be welcome.",nothing,"answer: nothing (this statement does not describe a fallacy as it is presented. it describes a situation and a proposed solution, without any logical fallacies being committed.)",True
544,Rather than adopting stiffer penalties for drug use we should focus more on counseling. Drug trafficking is another story.,nothing,answer: nothing (as the statement does not contain a fallacy in the given format),True
545,Computers should be allowed in classrooms.,nothing,"answer: appeal to authority (specifically, appeal to collective authority)

explanation: the reasoning given in this statement is that since multiple experts are involved and they will come to a final agreement, the conclusion must be valid. however, this does not necessarily mean that the conclusion is true. simply having multiple authorities does not guarantee agreement, especially when it comes to complex or subjective issues. additionally, even if there is an agreement among experts, this does not necessarily mean that their decision is correct, as it may be based on flawed logic or incorrect information.",False
546,"Personally, I’d go co-ed.",nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
547,"Yes, because drug-use in professional-sport is quite common. If we don't test for drugs now, soon nobody will be able to take part there without taking drugs.",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
548,"The instructions given in the New Testament, which Christians should observe, are peaceful and focused on love.",nothing,"answer: nothing

explanation: the statement does not present a fallacy. it simply states a fact about christian beliefs and practices. however, it could potentially be interpreted as an appeal to authority (if the source of the statement is not clear) if one assumes that the statement implies that only the new testament provides accurate information about christianity. but in this case, there is no such implication, so no fallacy occurs.",True
549,"Yes, our society definitely wants students to have children, for two reasons: First: students are smart, therefore their children might be smart, too. Second: older women have higher risks at giving birth. Students have the perfect age.",nothing,"answer: false cause fallacy

explanation: the statement assumes that because students are smart and of the ""perfect"" age, they should have children. this is a fallacy because there is no causal relationship between being smart or of the right age and having a child. there may be some correlation (i.e., intelligent people may choose to have children), but this does not imply a cause-and-effect relationship as suggested in the statement. additionally, the second reason given for wanting students to have children (older women having higher risks during pregnancy) is an irrelevant factor since it does not address why society wants students specifically to have children.",False
550,Nuclear energy should be invested in more.,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation: the statement suggests that investing in nuclear energy is correct because it is an agreement among experts. however, this argument relies on the conclusion (investing in nuclear energy) to support its premise (agreement among experts), creating a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared.",False
551,It allows to get useful data for human research.,nothing,"the given statement does not appear to describe a fallacy. instead, it describes a hypothetical scenario involving three experts and their process of reaching an agreement. therefore, the answer is 'answer: nothing'.",True
552,I don't think that's the case. Both companies serve different types of customers. Microsoft creates operating systems for the average pc-user whereas Apple has specialized in products for Yuppies.,nothing,answer: false analogy,False
553,It is against moral principles to torture or kill animals who feel pain.,nothing,"answer: nothing (or ""no fallacy"" if you prefer)
explanation: the statement presented here does not seem to exhibit any of the common logical fallacies, but rather presents a moral principle that many people would likely agree with. it's simply stating an argument in support of animal welfare without using illogical or misleading reasoning.",True
554,"Yes, if someone is bad at school or has some misbehavior, additional time in school could help him to catch up for lost time.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning
explanation: the argument relies on the premise that ""additional time in school"" will help a student catch up, which is the very action being considered. therefore, it is a fallacy type in which the proposition is supported by the premises, which is supported by the proposition, creating a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared.",False
555,Testing animals should be approved.,nothing,"answer: answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents only two possible outcomes (experts agreeing or experts leaving) when in fact there could be many more options, such as the experts continuing their discussions and reaching a compromise, or additional experts being brought in to provide further insights. this creates a false dichotomy by implying that agreement is the only valid outcome.",False
556,Of course they have been on the moon.,nothing,answer: nothing,True
557,"I think it can have an effect on students that will get them to correct their behavior, as they may be embarrassed that they have detention. However, kids who get detention all the time end up enjoying it because all of their friends are in there and it becomes more of a playground, instead of punishment.",nothing,answer: nothing,True
558,Many people are already killing themselves because they are terminally ill. It is their choice to choose if they want to live or die. A doctor should respect their choice and assist them either way.,nothing,"answer: slippery slope
explanation: the argument presents the idea that by allowing doctors to assist terminally ill patients in dying, a ""slippery slope"" of more and more people killing themselves will ensue. however, this is an overgeneralization from one situation (assisted suicide for terminally ill patients) to other situations (people voluntarily choosing death without illness). it ignores the fact that there are many factors and safeguards in place to prevent abuse of the practice.",False
559,Marijuana should be allowed as a medical drug.,nothing,answer: nothing (the statement provided does not explicitly demonstrate a fallacy in reasoning.),True
560,"Marijuana has been shown in some cases to alleviate negative side effects from chemotherapy treatments, even when other treatments for the same side effects were ineffective. Patients deserve legal access to medicines which, when prescribed by a physician, provide relief for their symptoms.",nothing,answer: nothing (the statement itself does not contain a fallacy as described in the examples provided.),True
561,"If a serious disease can be cured with the help of animal testing, we shouldn't hesitate.",nothing,answer: appeal to consequences,False
562,It makes less environmental damage in the short run than burning fossil fuel.,nothing,"'answer: false dilemma'
explanation: the statement presents only two options (less environmental damage vs burning fossil fuel), when in reality there are many other alternatives that could be considered, such as renewable energy sources or improving energy efficiency.",False
563,"Greek should leave Eurozone, because the consequences will be minimal for the Eurozone. The consequences will be hard for Greeks, but they got to this situation themselves.",nothing,"answer: false dilemma (or perhaps also appeal to self-interest)

explanation: in this statement, it is presented as if there are only two possible outcomes - either greece leaves the eurozone or stays in it, without considering other options or consequences for the eurozone. additionally, the argument assumes that greece alone bears the responsibility for their current situation, disregarding any external factors that may have contributed to their predicament.",False
564,Drug testing athletes is justified.,nothing,"answer: nothing (as there is no obvious fallacy in the statement itself, though it could be argued that an appeal to authority might be present if the justification for drug testing is based on expert opinions without providing any other evidence)",True
565,I support the strike in Deutsche Post. Everyone deserves fair working conditions.,nothing,"answer: argument from authority (implied) and hasty generalization

explanation: the statement implies that the expert is an authority on the issue of whether a strike in deutsche post is justified, but this has not been clearly stated. additionally, the statement makes a sweeping generalization that everyone deserves fair working conditions without providing evidence or context to support this claim. this could be misleading if there are circumstances where it might not apply, or if there are exceptions to this rule.",False
566,Television didn't destroy the communication among friends and families.,nothing,answer: nothing (since the statement does not present a fallacy),True
567,Children need daycare. But university is not the right place for daycare services. University is a place for education. There are enough existing public and private daycare-services. Put your children there.,nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
568,"The main point of high schools is educating, that's true. Nevertheless, university provides services, which you can get outside of university as well. Think about sports-fields or dining-halls. Why not daycare?",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
569,The grading system is not effective because it doesn't consider all types of learning styles of the students.,nothing,"the given statement does not present a fallacy. instead, it presents an argument about the effectiveness of a certain system (grading system) based on its inability to cater to various learning styles. it does not violate any logical principles or reasoning fallacies as described in the examples provided.

however, if we were to consider potential biases or errors within this argument, we could say that the claim assumes that all students have unique learning styles, which may not be universally true. but this is not a logical fallacy; rather, it might be an overgeneralization. the answer in this case would be 'answer: nothing.'",True
570,Social networking binds society closer together.,nothing,"answer: nothing (this statement does not present any logical fallacy as described in the provided examples, but it can be argued that it is an unsupported claim without evidence.)",True
571,Neuer is the best goalkeeper of the Soccer World Cup 2014.,nothing,"answer: nothing. the statement does not present a fallacy because it is merely stating an opinion without providing any argument or reasoning that would make it a fallacy. it only states that neuer is considered the best goalkeeper, but it doesn't imply any logical flaw in the reasoning or evidence used to support this claim.",True
572,"There are many cases where abortion should be legal. E.g., if a mother would die during the birth process, the state should leave the decision to her, as it is her life.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of omission
explanation: the argument provides examples of situations where abortion should be legal, but fails to acknowledge or consider other scenarios where an individual might argue for the opposite position. by limiting the discussion to specific circumstances, the argument overlooks potential counterarguments and contradictory viewpoints, making it incomplete and potentially biased.",False
573,Tests can be also conducted by numerical simulations.,nothing,"answer: answer: false dilemma (or, more specifically, false dichotomy)

explanation: in the scenario described, it appears that the only options presented are for the experts to either agree on a final classification or leave. however, there might exist other possibilities such as continuing discussions, seeking additional expert opinions, or re-evaluating their initial classifications based on new evidence or information. thus, the scenario presents a fallacy of false dilemma by limiting the options to only two extremes when more exist.",False
574,"No, because computers distract students. Very often they use computers for reasons not related to the class, which ultimately diminishes the educational effect of the class.",nothing,answer: false cause,False
575,Heavy Metal is just a genre.,nothing,answer: nothing (there is no fallacy being committed in this statement.),True
576,Flying cars are the consequent step forward in mobility technology.,nothing,"answer: anticipation of consequences (or possibly circular reasoning, depending on how one interprets the passage)
explanation: the statement assumes that because mobility technology has progressed in the past (cars replaced horses), it will continue to do so in the future (cars will eventually fly). however, this is not necessarily true. there are many factors that could influence whether flying cars become a reality, and it is premature to assume that they are the inevitable next step. additionally, if the experts in the scenario described are each only considering one step of reasoning at a time, they may overlook potential counterarguments or alternative solutions, leading to circular reasoning (each expert's justification for their conclusion relies on the conclusion of the previous expert).",False
577,"The animals are a part of nature like us and we, as humans, occupy their natural places. Not to harm them any further, they should have special rights.",nothing,"answer: nothing (or 'not applicable')

explanation: this statement presents an argument for giving animals special rights based on the premise that humans and animals are similar in nature. however, it does not present a fallacy as described, as there is no logical flaw or error in reasoning within the given text. the argument does not rely on a false dilemma, appeal to fear, authority, anger, tradition, straw man, equivocation, division, tu quoque, positive emotion, or pity. rather, it presents a moral argument for animal rights based on the shared characteristics of humans and animals as part of nature.",True
578,"Yes, there is obviously a need for it. I've read that about 5 percent of all students have children. Students usually have to attend lectures and won't be home until 4 pm.",nothing,"answer: answer: false dilemma
explanation: the statement suggests that because some students may have children, they will not be able to attend lectures before 4 pm. however, this assumption does not account for the possibility of other arrangements (e.g., childcare or flexible class schedules) that could accommodate these students. the two choices presented are unrealistic or oversimplified, thus creating a false dilemma.",False
579,Co-ed schools are better for life.,nothing,answer: nothing (it does not present a fallacy as it is not an argument),True
580,Christians should follow the rules of their religion.,nothing,answer: nothing,True
581,"No, the Scandinavian schools use another system and their students are the world's best. We are just average. It is not that effective.",nothing,"answer: argument from authority (appeal to expertise) combined with false dilemma.
explanation: the statement claims that since three experts (presumably in a field related to education or pedagogy) come to an agreement, their conclusion must be correct without any other evidence presented. this is a fallacy of argument from authority. additionally, the statement presents only two choices (scandinavian schools are best, and everyone else is average) despite the possibility that other factors or systems could contribute to educational success, making it a false dilemma.",False
582,"A group that refuses any diplomatic way on problem-solving and uses weapons straight away cannot be defeated without being at level with them, even though the number of those operations should be kept as small as possible.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of false cause
explanation: the argument assumes that because a group prefers to use weapons instead of diplomatic means, they can only be defeated by meeting their level of violence. however, this is not logically supported, as the use of force does not necessarily mean that it is the only or most effective way to defeat an opponent. there may be other factors, such as strategy and negotiation, that could lead to a successful resolution without escalating to violence. the argument commits the fallacy of false cause by assuming that correlation implies causation, when in reality there are many variables involved in any given situation.",False
583,Greece should leave the Eurozone because Europe needs to keep a responsible fiscal politics.,nothing,"answer: appeal to authority (specifically, a fallacy where the authority is not really an authority on the facts relevant to the argument)",False
584,Nuclear power is an effective and reasonable energy source.,nothing,"'answer: appeal to consensus'
explanation: the reasoning provided relies on the assumption that since multiple experts are involved, their final agreement would be correct. however, it does not guarantee that each expert has a sound argument or that they have not made any fallacious assumptions in reaching their conclusions.",False
585,"Yes, humans are not only mainly responsible for all current environmental problems, but we are also directly affected. We face problems like natural catastrophes, destruction of farmland, destruction of inhabitable areas, and loss of resources.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of composition
explanation: the statement assumes that what is true for one part (humans) is also true for the whole (the environment). however, this is not necessarily the case. while it may be true that humans are responsible for many environmental problems, it does not mean that the environment as a whole is directly affected by human actions in the same way. the environment includes non-human factors and systems that are not impacted by human activities in the same way humans are affected by those activities.",False
586,"Sorry, but your argument is a racist one. Germany has already acted like this in the past. We may not act like this again if we want to get a better reputation in the world.",nothing,answer: appeal to guilt by association (racism),False
587,It will reduce crime.,nothing,"answer: false cause
explanation: the argument implies that the act of experts sharing their thinking one step at a time and leaving if they realize they're wrong will have an effect on reducing crime. however, there is no evidence or logical connection between the two phenomena.",False
588,You should test athletes.,nothing,"the statement provided does not contain any identified fallacy. it suggests a method for reaching a consensus through a process of shared thinking and self-correction, which is not inherently flawed or fallacious. therefore, the answer is 'answer: nothing'.",True
589,Tests can be also conducted by numerical simulations.,nothing,answer: answer: circular reasoning,False
590,"No, because computers distract students. Very often they use computers for reasons not related to the class, which ultimately diminishes the educational effect of the class.",nothing,answer: false cause,False
591,Heavy Metal is just a genre.,nothing,"the reasoning given does not present a fallacy as described. it describes a process, not an argument or claim where a fallacy might be identified. therefore, the answer is 'answer: nothing'.",True
592,"The animals are a part of nature like us, and we, as humans, occupy their natural places. To not harm them any further, they should have special rights.",nothing,answer: false analogy,False
593,"Yes, there is obviously a need for it. I've read that about 5 percent of all students have children. Students usually have to attend lectures and won't be home until 4 pm.",nothing,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents two choices (the experts must come to a final agreement or leave) without considering the possibility that the process might continue indefinitely if no expert can reach an agreement. this is a fallacy as it implies that there are only two possible outcomes when in fact more exist.",False
594,Christians should follow the rules of their religion.,nothing,"answer: nothing. the statement is not necessarily a fallacy, but rather a declarative sentence expressing an opinion or belief. however, if the intention behind the statement is to suggest that only christians should be expected to follow their religious rules, while others are exempted, then it could potentially be considered an appeal to tradition (if christianity is being used as a traditional practice) or bias (if the statement suggests that christians are more deserving of respect or adherence than others). but without additional context, it's difficult to classify it as a specific fallacy.",True
595,"No, the Scandinavian schools use another system and their students are the world's best. We are just average. It is not that effective.",nothing,"answer: appeal to authority (fallacy of false authority)

explanation: the statement cites ""scandinavian schools"" as experts without providing evidence or reasoning to support their claim about the quality of education in these schools. additionally, it assumes all scandinavian schools have a consistent and superior educational system, which may not be the case. this is an example of using someone as an authority on a topic when they are not truly knowledgeable or qualified in that area, leading to a fallacy of false authority.",False
596,"A group that refuses any diplomatic way on problem-solving and uses weapons straight away cannot be defeated without being at level with them, even though the number of those operations should be kept as small as possible.",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
597,Greece should leave the Eurozone because Europe needs to keep a responsible fiscal politics.,nothing,"answer: false cause
explanation: the idea that europe needing to keep a responsible fiscal policy justifies greece leaving the eurozone is a fallacy of cause and effect. it assumes that leaving the eurozone would lead to europe adopting a more responsible fiscal policy, which may not necessarily be true or even possible.",False
598,Nuclear power is an effective and reasonable energy source.,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation: the argument assumes that because nuclear power is considered effective and reasonable (the conclusion), it must be so. however, the evidence or reason provided for the claim that nuclear power is effective and reasonable should support this conclusion, not the other way around. in this case, the argument is supporting its own premise, creating a circular reasoning fallacy.",False
599,"Yes, humans are not only mainly responsible for all current environmental problems, but we are also directly affected. We face problems like natural catastrophes, destruction of farmland, destruction of inhabitable areas, and loss of resources.",nothing,answer: nothing (there is no identifiable fallacy in the statement.),True
600,We should use animals as it is necessary to test.,nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
601,It will reduce crime.,nothing,"answer: false cause
explanation: the statement suggests that the process of having experts classify things in steps and coming to a final agreement will reduce crime. however, there is no logical connection or causal relationship between the two actions described (having experts classify things in steps and coming to a final agreement) and reducing crime.",False
602,You should test athletes.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma. explanation: the statement presents only one method (testing) for evaluating experts, while other methods might exist or be more appropriate.",False
603,"Yes, before the incidents in Cologne, no newspaper reported crimes from refugees. I don't think that before this date no crimes from refugees were committed.",nothing,answer: appeal to silence,False
604,"Yes, they have a positive impact, because you are much more connected to others than you were earlier. More communication means better understanding of others. And better understanding leads to a more peaceful society.",nothing,"'answer: circular reasoning'

explanation: the argument relies on its own premise (better understanding leads to a more peaceful society) to support its conclusion that the experts are connected and will come to an agreement, creating a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared.",False
605,"We need animal testing, even though it is horrible for the animals.",nothing,answer: appeal to consequences,False
606,"I am glad that you are able to dance your name, but please don't try to make every other child a softy as well.",nothing,answer: equivocation,False
607,"If you look at the history, you will see that humanity has already tried a lot of different political systems. Democracy has always been the one where people were the happiest. Therefore, I say, yes.",nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
608,Many other countries already allow it.,nothing,answer: appeal to tradition,False
609,I'm basically against single-sex education.,nothing,"answer: nothing (or no fallacy identified)

explanation: the statement does not seem to contain a specific logical fallacy in the wording as described above. it is simply an expression of personal opinion about single-sex education, and there is no apparent attempt to deceive or manipulate by using fallacious reasoning. however, if further context suggests that the speaker is using an appeal to emotion (e.g., fear of social change) or other fallacies to support their position, then a different answer would be appropriate.",True
610,Animal testing can have serious impacts on researching new technologies for curing diseases in humans.,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning
explanation: the argument relies on animal testing to prove the effectiveness of new technologies for human diseases, and yet the very effectiveness of these technologies is what is under question due to their impact on animals. thus, the conclusion is based on the premise itself, making it a circular reasoning fallacy.",False
611,"If my daughters can be in an environment that celebrates girls as intelligent, creative individuals, without the boy craziness, then I will take it.",nothing,answer: nothing (this statement does not provide a clear argument or premise that can be classified as a fallacy based on the information provided.),True
612,Germany should deal with the criminal refugees there and not force them onto another country. Deal with your problems yourself.,nothing,answer: appeal to shame,False
613,"No, because they are near to human in terms of evolution and I would not want to be held in a zoo.",nothing,answer: false analogy,False

615,We should allow it.,nothing,answer: answer: false dilemma,False
616,Adherents to a religion should follow the rules.,nothing,answer: answer: appeal to tradition,False
617,"Well in Germany this is not the case. The legal system works differently. The state prosecutor's main task is not to get you in jail, like it is in the USA. He has to investigate in both directions. That's why the process costs are less and that's why it is fair. Celebrities have the same chance as the average citizen.",nothing,"answer: appeal to culture
explanation: the arguer is using the cultural difference between the united states and germany to support their argument, specifically that the legal system in germany is fair because of its differences from the legal system in the united states. however, this argument does not provide evidence or reasoning to show why one system is better than the other, nor does it take into account that different cultures may have different ideas about what constitutes a fair legal system. the arguer is therefore using cultural differences as an argument for their position without providing any substantive support for their claim.",False
618,Every human has his right to choose what he wants.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma (explaining reasoning: the statement presents a false dichotomy by implying that there are only two choices, in this case, the choice of an individual, when in reality there might be other options or considerations as well)",False
619,"No, economic growth is a tool to establish a good economy, which allows us to live a good life. Growth for a good life, not life for economic growth.",nothing,"the statement does not present a fallacy as described. it states a perspective on the relationship between economic growth and quality of life without making any false, misleading, or invalid claims. therefore, 'answer: nothing'.",True
620,"Germany should help immigrants in need. Most of them left their homes not because of social or economic benefits, but because of the war.",nothing,"the reasoning provided does not describe a fallacy, it describes a hypothetical scenario or process for reaching an agreement among experts. therefore, the answer is 'answer: nothing'.",True
621,Greece needs to stay in the EU for unity of Europe.,nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
622,"Plastic surgery is very important, many people who got involved in severe accidents will tell you this. Think about victims of flames. Their bodies are often unrecognizably destroyed. Plastic surgery gives them their lives back.",nothing,"answer: argument from authority (fallacy)

explanation: the reasoning presented here relies on the testimony of ""many people who got involved in severe accidents"" as an authority for the claim that plastic surgery is important. however, these individuals are not qualified experts in the field of plastic surgery, and their personal experiences do not necessarily qualify them to speak authoritatively about its importance or benefits. the argument assumes that because victims of severe accidents believe plastic surgery is helpful in restoring their lives, it must be an accurate or reliable authority on the subject.",False
623,"The strike is not justified, because the DP-workers work less than the average German worker but are paid average. Their conditions are okay.",nothing,"answer: false cause (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc)
explanation: the argument assumes that just because the dp-workers work less than the average german worker but are paid average, and their conditions are okay, it means the strike is not justified. however, this does not prove that one event (the work conditions being acceptable) causes the other event (the strike not being justified). it could be that there are other factors at play leading to the workers' decision to strike that have not been considered in the argument.",False
624,School detention does more harm than good.,nothing,"answer: false cause
explanation: the argument assumes that because the experts are going through steps and coming to a final agreement, they will all come to the same conclusion about school detention causing more harm than good, when in reality, their individual perspectives, expertise, and reasoning may lead to different conclusions. this is a fallacy of false cause, as the connection between the process (experts going through steps) and the conclusion (school detention does more harm than good) is not logically sound.",False
625,You should try to talk to your opponents - reasonable discussions and knowing why there is a clash of ideas is hard but gets you further than a simple brute force (= war).,nothing,"answer: answer: nothing. this statement does not describe a fallacy, as it presents an opinion or advice about communication strategies rather than a logical error in reasoning.",True
626,Letting everyone vote is a bad idea.,nothing,"answer: nothing (no fallacy in this statement itself, but it implies a lack of specific fallacy in the reasoning)

explanation: the statement does not commit any fallacy directly. however, if someone were to argue against letting everyone vote based on a fallacy, that would be an issue with their argument, not the original statement. for example, if someone argued that letting everyone vote is bad because ""most people are stupid and will make poor decisions,"" this would be an appeal to ignorance. but the statement itself does not contain any specific fallacy in the reasoning it presents.",True
627,Of course not.,nothing,"the given scenario does not describe a specific argument or statement, and it is not clear how it relates to a fallacy. however, if we interpret it as a description of a process where experts try to reach an agreement based on their individual steps without allowing for new information or discussion, this could be compared to the ""delphic method"" or ""group think."" these are not necessarily classified as fallacies but rather patterns of decision-making that can lead to flawed conclusions.

so, the answer would be: 'answer: delphic method (or group think)' if we stretch the interpretation a bit.",False
628,Economical growth should not be the main goal of a country.,nothing,answer: nothing (the reasoning steps as described do not provide enough information to classify a specific fallacy),True
629,Drug testing is justified as it is necessary to create a fair and competitive environment.,nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
630,Apple must pay the royalties for the streaming trial. The musicians don't ask for free iPhones either.,nothing,answer: false analogy,False

634,"TV programs are driven by commercial interest, not science or experts.",nothing,answer: nothing. the given statement does not describe a fallacy since it is stating a fact rather than making an argument with logical flaws.,True
635,Plastic surgery is a crucial field of medicine.,nothing,answer: nothing (the statement does not contain a fallacy as described in the scenario),True
636,"If they are political refugees, we have a duty to help them.",nothing,answer: appeal to obligation,False
637,"Really, nobody has the right to tell me what I can do at my home!",nothing,"answer: false dilemma. explanation: the statement presents a binary choice (what one can do at their home) as if it is the only possible choice, when in fact there are other choices and options available. this creates a fallacy of oversimplification or misrepresentation of the situation by not considering all viable alternatives.",False
638,It is the only way to get reliable results.,nothing,"the reasoning given describes a group of experts reaching an agreement through a process where they each share one step of their thinking at a time, and if any expert realizes they are wrong at any point, they leave. however, this description does not explicitly mention any logical fallacy. therefore, the answer is 'answer: nothing'.",True
639,Yes. Criminals are a danger to Germany's society.,nothing,answer: argument from authority (if it is assumed that the experts are being used as authorities on this matter) or nothing (if it is understood that the question does not ask for an analysis of a specific fallacy but rather describes a hypothetical scenario),True

641,Disallowing people from Ebola infected countries to enter another country is against human rights.,nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
642,Flying cars will become reality someday.,nothing,"'answer: circular reasoning'

explanation: the reasoning presented is a circular argument, where the conclusion (flying cars will become reality) is used as one of the premises supporting that same conclusion. in this case, the idea that experts must come to a final agreement implies that if they don't agree, flying cars won't become reality; however, this assumption contradicts the initial claim about the eventuality of flying cars.",False
643,"Yes, Jesus has almost never used force. Just once to chase away some merchants. He preached of love and forgiveness. The religion builds upon his teachings, so yes, it is peaceful.",nothing,"answer: nothing (or ""no fallacy detected"")

explanation: while the statement does contain opinions and subjective interpretations about jesus and christianity, it does not appear to be a fallacy as defined in the context provided. the statement presents an argument without employing a logical fallacy, such as oversimplifying choices (false dilemma), using fear as a primary motivator (appeal to fear), or relying on false authority, among others. the statement simply explains and interprets religious beliefs and history.",True
644,There are more gorillas raised in zoos and re-introduced into the wild than captured and kept.,nothing,"the reasoning described does not seem to involve a fallacy. it is a hypothetical scenario about how experts might classify something. however, if we were to analyze it based on the given structure, there doesn't appear to be an argument or conclusion being presented for evaluation as a fallacy.

answer: 'answer: nothing'",True
645,"That is true. However, we cannot be sure others will be responsible.",nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
646,Censorship helps protect children.,nothing,"answer: nothing (this statement can be debated, it does not necessarily follow a logical fallacy in the given format)",True
647,"With the actual milk price, the cows can be appropriately held, and the farmers can still achieve some earnings.",nothing,answer: nothing,True
648,"Yes, homeschooling, everyone.",nothing,"the statement describes a scenario, not an argument or claim, so it doesn't fit the format for identifying a fallacy. therefore, answer: 'nothing'. however, if we were to interpret it as an argument, it could be seen as a fallacy of consensus (or majority rule), where the assumption is that because three experts are doing something, they must be correct and will eventually reach agreement. but in reality, there can be disagreement among experts, even those with expertise in the same field.",True
649,I think Titanic deserves 11 Oscars at once.,nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
650,"He killed, yes. But this does not mean that it is impossible to talk to him. If we can save lives by this way, we should do it.",nothing,answer: nothing (no fallacy detected in the given statement),True
651,The current grading system just fails.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement suggests that the only two possible outcomes are either all experts agree or they don't. however, there might be situations where some experts agree and others do not, but still have valid arguments based on their expertise. thus, it ignores other possibilities, presenting a fallacious either/or situation.",False
652,Democracy is peaceful.,nothing,"answer: nothing (or 'not applicable')

explanation: the statement does not provide a reasoning process or argument that can be classified as a fallacy. it simply states an opinion about democracy being peaceful without any justification, comparison, or contradiction to support the claim. therefore, it is not a fallacy but rather a simple declarative sentence expressing an opinion.",True
653,Adolescence is hard enough without having to try learning in an environment of hormone-laced competition and distraction.,nothing,"answer: equivocation

explanation: the term ""hard"" is being used ambiguously, as it could refer to the emotional difficulty or intellectual challenge. however, the argument about adolescence being hard due to hormonal distractions does not logically imply that learning in such an environment would be more difficult because of emotional strain rather than the distraction itself.",False
654,"The technical expertise is there, having space ships, airplanes etc., and sooner or later humans have always used technology to their advantage and to make things more comfortable/easier for them.",nothing,answer: nothing (this statement does not present a fallacy as it simply describes a historical trend without making any false arguments or reasoning fallacies),True
655,Same-sex couples should have access to the same benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples.,nothing,answer: nothing (no fallacy is present in this statement),True
656,"Alle, die hier leben sollten auch involviert sein, wenn es darum geht was hier in Zukunft passiert. (Everyone living here should also be involved when it comes to deciding what happens here in the future.)",nothing,answer: appeal to emotion,False
657,"Smoking at home is dangerous, as exactly as eating cheese at home or walking up and down stairs. There is no explicit reason to make it illegal.",nothing,"'answer: false equivalence'
explanation: smoking at home presents unique dangers (such as fire risks and health hazards from secondhand smoke) that are not inherent in other activities like eating cheese or walking up and down stairs. therefore, equating smoking with these activities is a fallacy of false equivalence because it incorrectly assumes that they have the same level of danger or risk.",False
658,Microsoft can't be the new Apple. Apple focuses on innovative design. Microsoft focuses on software for productivity and products that don't have to be innovative in design.,nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
659,"Some shows on TV serve educational purposes, but most of them are totally worthless. There is no chance that a mind of a child builds up, when it watches Celebrity-news.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of hasty generalization

explanation: the statement makes the assumption that since most tv shows are considered worthless (which is a subjective judgment), all shows on tv serve no educational purpose. this is an oversimplification and overgeneralization, as it ignores the existence of other types of tv shows that may have educational value. the statement jumps to a conclusion based on insufficient or inadequate evidence.",False
660,"Yes, companies are already working on creating cars which are able to fly quite successfully. Thus, flying cars will become reality in the near future.",nothing,"answer: future contingents
explanation: the statement makes a prediction about the future (flying cars becoming reality) based on current evidence. however, it is not possible to know for certain whether this future event will occur or not, as it has not happened yet. therefore, any argument that relies on future contingents to make its conclusion is fallacious.",False
661,"Yes, school uniforms do create a better learning environment.",nothing,"answer: nothing (fallacy not found)
explanation: the statement does not present any fallacy in the wording as described above since it is stating an opinion and providing reasoning without relying on faulty logic or reasoning.",True
662,Home school provides a better education than underfunded public schools.,nothing,"the statement provided is not explicitly presented in the format of a reasoning process as described, where each step of thinking is shared with the group and experts leave if they realize they are wrong at any point. therefore, it does not appear to be a fallacy based on that format. however, if we were to analyze the statement itself independently, it could potentially be considered an 'appeal to tradition' or 'appeal to anecdote' fallacy depending on how the argument is framed and what evidence is provided. for example, if the argument relies solely on the fact that home schooling has been practiced for a long time without any additional supporting evidence or data, it would be an 'appeal to tradition'. if the argument is based on a single anecdote or personal story without any broader context or statistical data, it would be an 'appeal to anecdote'. however, in this case, we cannot definitively classify it as a fallacy because we do not have enough information about how the argument was presented.

so, answer: nothing (for the given statement and format described). if more context were provided, it might be classified as 'appeal to tradition' or 'appeal to anecdote'.",True
663,Alternative energy resources are too expensive.,nothing,"answer: nothing (or no fallacy identified in the statement itself)

explanation: the statement simply presents an opinion or claim about alternative energy resources without any explicit use of a logical fallacy. however, if the argument is being made based on the assumption that all experts will agree and continue until they reach a conclusion, this could be considered a form of groupthink or circular reasoning, as the argument relies on the consensus of the group rather than independent reasoning and evidence. but this is not explicitly stated in the given statement.",True
664,This would cause significant disadvantages for children from non-academic families.,nothing,answer: nothing,True
665,Animal testing for medical purposes should be allowed.,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning. the argument relies on the premise that animal testing is necessary for medical purposes, and then uses the fact that it is being done for medical purposes as evidence that it should continue. this creates a circular argument where the conclusion is based on the premises, which in turn are based on the conclusion.",False
666,Microsoft is the new apple.,nothing,answer: false analogy,False
667,"It is obvious that anyone has been on the moon. Meanwhile, 2015, there have been quite a lot expeditions to the moon. The newer ones were even livestreamed on Twitter and co. Don't tell me the government fakes livestreams.",nothing,answer: appeal to popularity,False
668,To find out if there is a reason for the American war on terror let's take a look at the results nearly one and a half decade later.,nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
669,Cellphones should be banned from classrooms.,nothing,answer: nothing (as the reasoning is not presented in the format specified),True
670,It is best to home school our kids.,nothing,"'answer: appeal to tradition' (this statement uses the traditional practice of homeschooling as evidence, disregarding modern educational research and methods.)",False
671,"It has to be balanced, but for life-saving drugs, it should be allowed on non-endangered animal species.",nothing,answer: slippery slope,False
672,Animal testing helps to improve medical care for everybody.,nothing,"answer: appeal to consequences (also known as appeal to beneficent consequences)

explanation: the argument relies on the positive consequence of improving medical care for everyone, but this does not justify animal testing itself. the use of animals in experiments can be morally questionable and it is not a justification if there are positive outcomes. therefore, the reasoning is fallacious because it uses the beneficial consequences of an action as evidence to support its validity or necessity, ignoring other important factors such as ethics and morality.",False
673,"They brought several kilos of moon rocks back to earth, and you cannot simply fake four billion years old rock material.",nothing,"'answer: circular reasoning'
explanation: the argument relies on the fact that moon rocks are real because they are real moon rocks. in other words, the premise assumes what it is supposed to prove, creating a circular argument where no useful information is being shared.",False
674,"I don't think so, he lived too short in order to have the most influence. Dr. Dre for example had much more influence. He started the rap-movement with Eazy-E and Ice Cube. He just sold his headphone brand for around 250 million dollars. This amount of money shows how influential Dr. Dre is. Tupac never had this much money.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation: the argument relies on the premise that influence can be measured by financial success, which in turn is used to support the claim that tupac was not as influential as dr. dre. however, the justification for the premise is based on the conclusion (dr. dre's financial success).",False
675,Marijuana has been shown to be effective in treating glaucoma.,nothing,"answer: nothing (this statement does not present a fallacy, but rather a factual claim about marijuana and its potential medical benefits.)",True
676,That Marijuana should be legalized.,nothing,answer: nothing (as it does not describe a specific fallacy),True
677,"Although any suffering of living creatures should be avoided, I guess it's commonly accepted by the society that medical purposes testing has more benefits than harms.",nothing,"answer: answer: circular reasoning

explanation: the statement assumes that if something is commonly accepted by society as having more benefits than harms (in this case, medical research), then those benefits outweigh any suffering of living creatures. however, the justification for accepting it as common knowledge in the first place relies on the very point being argued: that the benefits outweigh the harms. this creates a circular argument where the conclusion is used to support the premise, and vice versa.",False
678,"This programming language is open for everybody, so it encourages more developers to participate.",nothing,answer: appeal to popularity,False
679,Only a few countries contribute to the majority of pollution.,nothing,"the reasoning provided does not contain a clear and specific fallacy within the given format. however, if we are to interpret it in a broader context, it might resemble an argument by analogy where the analogy is flawed or misleading (fallacy of false cause). the reasoning suggests that if three experts agree on something (analogous to all countries contributing to pollution), then they must come to a final agreement (analogous to the answer being correct). this could be problematic because not all decisions in real life are reached through consensus, and even experts can make mistakes. but again, this is an interpretation rather than a direct match to the provided format.

answer: 'answer: nothing' (based on the given format) or 'answer: fallacy of false cause' (if we interpret the reasoning in a broader context)",True
680,Renewable energy sources will not soon replace fossil fuels.,nothing,"the scenario given does not present a clear argument or fallacy, so it is difficult to classify it as a fallacy. however, if we interpret the statement ""imagine three different experts are doing this classification"" as an attempt to make the claim seem reasonable by appealing to the position of authority (experts), then it could be considered a form of appeal to authority. but without more context or steps in the argument, it is hard to definitively say that it is a fallacy.

answer: answer: potential appeal to authority",False
681,"Well, Ebola is a disease and it makes sense to coordinate countries worldwide to fight against it. To me, global environmental task force sounds fuzzy without a clear purpose. We don't need such an organization.",nothing,"answer: answer: false dichotomy (or slippery slope fallacy)
explanation: the statement suggests that there are only two choices or paths: coordinating countries to fight ebola or establishing a global environmental task force. however, it is possible and plausible for countries to coordinate efforts against both diseases simultaneously. the statement also implies that creating the proposed global environmental task force will have negative consequences (being ""fuzzy without a clear purpose""), which may not necessarily be true. the use of the term ""without a clear purpose"" suggests that any organization without an explicitly defined and limited scope is inherently problematic, but this is a fallacious assumption as many organizations can operate successfully with broad or flexible mandates.",False
682,Humans are to blame for some animal extinctions.,nothing,"the given statement is not explicitly presented in a manner that can be categorized as a specific fallacy. however, if we consider the reasoning process implied in the statement, it seems to follow the structure of an argument by analogy (or analogical reasoning), which is not classified as a fallacy but rather a type of reasoning.

in this case:
1. humans have caused some animal extinctions.
2. if we replace ""humans"" with another category, ""cats,"" we can say that cats have caused some bird extinctions (example: domestic cats hunting birds).
3. from the analogy, it is inferred that other species might also be causing animal extinctions.

however, this reasoning process does not necessarily constitute a fallacy since it is a valid form of reasoning when applied correctly, but it may lead to misleading or incorrect conclusions if the analogy is too broad or the relationships between the categories are not well-defined. in this case, the reasoning seems reasonable and valid as long as we understand that the conclusion should be treated as an hypothesis, requiring further investigation and evidence before making a definitive statement.

so in this scenario, there is no fallacy being committed, but rather an argument by analogy being employed to make an inference.",False
683,Yes. It will allow the mothers to go to school and help the children to grow up better.,nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
684,"Economic experts say that further austerity measures will not be beneficial, so we should help Greece with new investment to keep it in the Eurozone.",nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
685,"In modern jobs, home office is already the standard, because the workers are more productive at home. Why shouldn't this be better for kids as well?",nothing,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

explanation: the term ""home office"" in the context of modern jobs refers to a work environment where employees can work from their homes. however, in the following sentence, ""home office"" is being used to refer to a completely different concept - an educational setting for children. therefore, the argument is fallacious because it uses an ambiguous term with more than one sense, thus making the argument misleading.",False
686,Neuer is the best goalkeeper of the World Cup by far as he let very few balls slip by.,nothing,answer: appeal to popularity,False
687,Kids need to go to a proper school and home schooling harms them.,nothing,answer: false dilemma,False

689,Athletes definitely should be drug tested!,nothing,answer: nothing (this statement does not explicitly present a fallacy),True
690,The EU would be better adapting so that Greece is able to function well while staying in the country.,nothing,"answer: fallacy of presupposition
explanation: the statement assumes that greece must stay within the eu for it to function well, but this assumption has not been proven or discussed. instead, the argument should focus on whether or not greece being within the eu is beneficial for its function and success, without assuming it as a given fact.",False
691,But every country that agreed to be in the EU agreed to an obligation to support other EU countries.,nothing,"answer: fallacy of composition

explanation: the statement assumes that what is true for each individual part (each country) is also true for the whole (the eu). however, this is not always the case as the eu is a collective entity and the obligations it has are not necessarily shared individually by its member countries.",False
692,"If marijuana is provided by the pharmacies or health centers to the individuals with prescriptions for health purposes in a controlled way, that should be allowed.",nothing,answer: argument from consequences (slippery slope),False
693,"Everyone can choose what movies to watch, and we should respect everyone's preferences.",nothing,"answer: answer: false dilemma
explanation: the statement presents only two choices (everyone choosing their own movies or respecting everyone's preferences), whereas there might be other options that exist, such as compromising on movie choices, taking turns in selecting movies, or watching different movies at different times. therefore, it is a fallacy where only two choices are presented yet more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes.",False
694,Making money out of someone else's art product is stealing. Apple should simply avoid that and pay the royalties.,nothing,answer: false analogy,False
695,Of course they should be allowed to enter the country.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma
explanation: in this scenario, it is presented that the only two options are for the experts to agree or leave. however, in a real-life situation, there may be other options such as further discussion, seeking more information, or even revisiting the initial question. therefore, it is a fallacy where only two choices are presented yet more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes.",False
696,"The price of milk should not be increased. It is an important healthy drink. If we increase it, things like pop might become the more affordable go-to choice.",nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
697,"After reminding the baby-carrier woman of the consequences and the possible health-related problems, the decision should be left to first her and second to the partner because the woman is the laborer of the process and both parties are the initial responsibles.",nothing,"answer: false dilemma (explanation: the statement presents a limited number of options for responsibility in making the decision, when other possibilities exist such as shared responsibility or input from others who may also be affected by the decision.)",False
698,We need to prevent another school tragedy so one way to do that would be to have 911 at hand at all times.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma.

explanation: the statement presents only two options (having 911 at all times or preventing another school tragedy) while there may be other, viable solutions. it fails to consider alternative possibilities and presents a binary choice where in fact, a spectrum of choices exists between the two extremes suggested.",False
699,"You can have several hundred friends on Facebook. In the real world, it is impossible.",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
700,"No. No one deserves that title. Since players play such different positions, you can't really compare goalies and offensive players and defensive players. Perhaps you could argue that someone was the best player in a position, but Ronaldo and others can't be named the best in the world.",nothing,"answer: answer: circular reasoning

explanation: the argument here is that no one deserves to be considered the best player in the world because players play different positions and therefore cannot be compared. however, the very act of declaring someone as the ""best player in the world"" inherently involves comparing players across positions. if it were not possible to compare players across positions, then there would be no reason to make such a declaration in the first place. thus, the argument is essentially using its own premise (the impossibility of comparing players across positions) as evidence for its conclusion (no one deserves to be considered the best player in the world), creating a circular reasoning fallacy.",False
701,Animal testing leads to medicaments with fewer harmful side effects.,nothing,"answer: false cause

explanation: the statement suggests that animal testing causes medicaments with fewer harmful side effects, but this is not necessarily true. animal testing may provide valuable information about drug safety and efficacy, but it does not guarantee that the resulting medicine will have fewer harmful side effects for humans. many other factors can influence the safety and efficacy of a drug in humans, including differences in metabolism, genetics, and disease etiology between animals and humans. therefore, the statement is a fallacy known as false cause, where a causal relationship is assumed or implied without sufficient evidence to support it.",False
702,Because all immigrants must be equal.,nothing,"answer: nothing (this statement is not necessarily a fallacy, but rather a statement of opinion.)",True
703,We should allow animal testing!,nothing,"answer: false dilemma. explanation: the scenario describes a process where only three experts are allowed to participate, and they must all come to an agreement. however, it does not specify that there are no other experts or sources of information that could also contribute to the discussion about whether animal testing should be allowed. therefore, by presenting only this specific process as the method for making a decision, the argument is limiting the possibilities and potentially ignoring other relevant evidence or expert opinions, which is a false dilemma fallacy.",False
704,Animal testing is a good alternative to human testing.,nothing,"answer: nothing (there isn't a specific fallacy in the statement, but it can be argued that the argument assumes an extreme dichotomy between animal and human testing without considering other alternatives or ethical considerations.)",True
705,Microsoft just recently revealed some great new innovative products.,nothing,"answer: nothing

the scenario described does not involve a fallacy. it is simply describing a process of reaching an agreement through discussion and consensus among experts. there are no logical fallacies in the presented statement.",True
706,A global environment task force is a major requirement.,nothing,"answer: nothing. the scenario does not present a fallacy, but rather describes a hypothetical process for reaching an agreement among experts.",True
707,It is not fair to judge students by grades.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma
explanation: in this statement, only two choices (judging or not judging students by grades) are presented, but a spectrum of possible choices exists between these two extremes. the statement incorrectly assumes that the only way to evaluate students is through grades, when in reality there may be other valid evaluation methods such as self-assessment, peer reviews, project completion, etc.",False
708,"Every country should aim for growth, but ultimately environmental sustainability and equalitarian distribution of wealth should be first.",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
709,"Single sex education has been very good for girls, especially.",nothing,answer: nothing (this statement does not appear to be a fallacy as it simply expresses an opinion on a topic without using logical fallacies.),True
710,"With the goal in mind to improve everyone's situation, growth is good for a country.",nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
711,Medicine has proven that marijuana is good to mitigate some bad effects of cancer-related side effects. Make it easier for those patients and legalize it.,nothing,"answer: slippery slope fallacy

explanation: the argument states that because marijuana can help manage certain cancer-related side effects, therefore it should be legalized. however, the argument does not provide a logical connection between the two statements. allowing marijuana for medical use might lead to its recreational use, which is considered a slippery slope fallacy since it assumes that a small action will inevitably and uncontrollably lead to much larger or negative consequences.",False
712,Animal testing helps save lives.,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation: the argument is that animal testing saves lives, but it assumes that the only way to find out if a treatment works is through animal testing, thus creating a circular reasoning where the conclusion relies on the premise for its validity without providing any other evidence or reason.",False
713,Farmers deserve to be paid enough.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma
explanation: the statement suggests that farmers either deserve to be paid enough or they don't, but it fails to acknowledge any other alternatives such as a discussion about the appropriate wage level, factors affecting the wage, and so on. thus, it presents only two extremes while more options exist in this situation.",False
714,Home schooling has many benefits and therefore should be the first choice for parents.,nothing,"answer: appeal to benefit (also known as argumentum ad consequentiam)

explanation: the statement suggests that home schooling is the best choice because it has many benefits. however, having benefits does not necessarily make something the best choice in all cases. there may be other factors to consider, such as the child's learning style, socialization needs, and the parents' ability to effectively teach at home. therefore, the argument relies on the desirable consequence of ""many benefits"" without considering other important factors that might suggest a different conclusion.",False
715,"I don't think daycare services should be provided by high schools themselves, rather existing facilities (kindergarten) should be used. The main point of high schools is to educate people, not to care about babies.",nothing,answer: appeal to tradition,False
716,Children are not active when sitting in front of a TV.,nothing,"'answer: false dilemma'
explanation: the statement implies that children can either be active or sit in front of a tv, but it overlooks the possibility that children might still be engaging in some level of activity (e.g., exercise, games) while watching tv. thus, it presents only two options when more exist.",False
717,"Although it is a barbarian act, we need animal testing.",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False

720,Animal testing for medical purposes should be allowed.,nothing,"answer: answer: circular reasoning (the argument assumes that since the experts agree, they are correct, but the agreement is based on their initial premise about animal testing.)",False
721,"No. Greece is one of the countries that, in its history, has contributed to a European union the most. Throwing this country out of it, would therefore destroy confidence in this community, the most.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of composition
explanation: the statement incorrectly assumes that what applies to some part (greece) will also apply to the whole (european union). the consequences of removing one country from the union may not necessarily affect the entire community in the same way as suggested by the argument.",False

723,"To revisit the oceans paleotemperatures now, we need to carefully quantify this re-equilibration, which has been overlooked for too long. For that, we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time.",nothing,answer: nothing (since the passage does not present an argument and therefore no fallacy is committed),True
724,Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated.,nothing,"answer: nothing (there is no fallacy in the statement itself, but if it were used in an argumentative context, it could potentially be used as an example of an appeal to authority if the source of the information about the scientific consensus on sea ice loss was not properly established.)",True
725,Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up.,nothing,"'answer: hasty generalization'
explanation: the statement makes a broad conclusion (mass coral bleaching being a new phenomenon) based on a limited observation period (since the 1980s). however, it is possible that coral bleaching events occurred before this time but were not recognized or documented. thus, it is hasty to assume that coral bleaching is a recent phenomenon solely based on the available data.",False
726,"Back in the late 1980s, the UN claimed that if global warming were not checked by 2000, rising sea levels would wash entire countries away.",nothing,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents only two possible outcomes (global warming is not checked by 2000 or it is), while in reality there are many possibilities between these extremes. for example, global warming might be slowed but not completely stopped, or the effects of global warming might not manifest as dramatically as predicted. therefore, the statement oversimplifies the situation by presenting only two options when more exist.",False
727,Extremely remarkable 2017 heads toward record for hottest year without an El Niño episode.,nothing,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement seems to suggest that the only two possibilities for the year being extremely hot are having an el niño episode or not, when in reality there could be other factors contributing to the heat.",False
728,"The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours.",nothing,"answer: false cause
explanation: the statement infers that the unusual warmth caused the tropical storm to become a category-four hurricane quickly. however, it does not provide any evidence or reason to support this claim. it is possible that other factors contributed to the rapid intensification of the hurricane, and it would be fallacious to attribute it solely to the warm temperatures.",False

730,"Scientists such as Dr Willie Soon, a solar astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, have shown that as water vapor rises, so does temperature. It is why cloudless nights are so chilly.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation step by step:
1. the statement claims that as water vapor rises, so does temperature.
2. this claim is then used as an explanation for why cloudless nights are so chilly (since there are no clouds to trap the heat).
3. however, the initial claim is based on the fact that temperatures rise when water vapor rises, and this same claim is being used in the second part of the argument as evidence that the statement is true. this creates a circular reasoning fallacy where the conclusion supports its premise, which in turn supports the conclusion.",False
731,"Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) from 1901 to 2010, and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century.",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False

735,"Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean, and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere.",nothing,answer: nothing,True
736,"Last year's warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef experienced its worst coral bleaching event on record and large scale coral death, to the Arctic, where sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were also the warmest on record, at least from January through September 2016.",nothing,"answer: nothing (there is no clear fallacy in this statement as it presents facts and observations about the climate, not arguments or conclusions.)",True
737,"We have known for decades that increasing CO2 and precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century, it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent.",nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
738,"Because the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically, the continued existence of the world's great coastal cities — Miami, New York, Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica's fate.",nothing,answer: false dilemma,False
739,"Warm weather worsened the most recent five-year drought, which included the driest four-year period on record in terms of statewide precipitation. California’s first-, second-, and third-hottest years on record, in terms of statewide average temperatures, were 2014, 2015, and 2016.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

explanation: the statement assumes that ""worsened"" means the same as ""hottest"". however, in one case it refers to drought (a lack of precipitation), and in another case it refers to temperature (heat). therefore, the argument is misleading because the meaning of the word is not consistent throughout.",False
740,Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic's summer sea-ice cover.,nothing,"answer: answer: fallacy of hasty generalization
explanation: the argument is making a sweeping statement about ""most people"" expecting a certain outcome, but it does not provide any evidence or data to support that claim. it assumes that everyone has the same expectation based on limited information or anecdotes, which is not likely true in reality.",False
741,"At the bottom of the world, sea ice is also at all-time record low levels around Antarctica, the data center said. The lack of ice in the Antarctic, where it is currently summer, is most pronounced in the Amundsen Sea, where only a few scattered patches of ice remain.",nothing,answer: appeal to authority (circumstantial),False
742,"Incorporating recent advances in the understanding of how ice sheets might break apart, they found that both West Antarctica and some vulnerable parts of East Antarctica would go into an unstoppable collapse if the Earth continued to warm at a rapid pace. In their worst-case scenario, the sea level could rise by six feet by the end of this century, and the pace could pick up drastically in the 22nd century. Dr. DeConto and Dr. Pollard do not claim that this is a certainty — they acknowledge that their analysis is still rough — but they argue that the possibility should be taken seriously.",nothing,answer: nothing,True
743,"An inherent bias in scientific journals in favor of more calamitous predictions has excluded research showing that marine creatures are not damaged by ocean acidification, which is caused by the sea absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",nothing,"answer: false cause fallacy

explanation: the statement assumes that the absence of research supporting a claim implies causality between the two events (ocean acidification and marine creatures being unaffected), when in fact there are many possible reasons for this absence of evidence, such as lack of funding or resources to conduct such studies, or difficulties in publishing results that contradict established consensus. the correlation between the two events does not necessarily imply a causal relationship, making it a false cause fallacy.",False
744,"The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century. The risk is that the rate will increase still more. Scientists who study the Earth's history say waters could rise by a foot per decade in a worst-case scenario, though that looks unlikely. Many experts believe that even if emissions stopped tomorrow, 15 or 20 feet of sea level rise is already inevitable, enough to flood many cities unless trillions of dollars are spent protecting them. How long it will take is unclear. But if emissions continue apace, the ultimate rise could be 80 or 100 feet.",nothing,"'answer: false dilemma'

explanation: the statement presents two extreme scenarios (a foot per decade or a foot per century) as the only possible outcomes, when in reality there may be a spectrum of possibilities in between these extremes. it creates a fallacious binary choice where more options exist.",False
745,"CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent.",nothing,"answer: false dilemma
explanation: the statement seems to present only two components (co2 and water vapor) when it comes to greenhouse gases, implying they are the only ones that matter, while ignoring other potential contributors. however, it is important to consider all possible greenhouse gases, not just co2 and water vapor.",False
746,"The atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is five years and it is quickly sequestered into plants, marine life, oceans, and sediments.",nothing,"the given statement does not describe a fallacy. it is simply stating facts about the atmospheric residence time and fate of carbon dioxide in the environment. therefore, the answer would be: 'answer: nothing'.",True
747,"Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the average pH of global ocean surface waters has fallen from pH 8.2 to 8.1. This represents an increase in acidity of about 26%.",nothing,"the reasoning described is not a fallacy per se, but it could potentially lead to groupthink or bandwagon effect, as all experts are reaching consensus through a process where dissenting opinions are gradually eliminated. however, the question asks for a specific classification based on the wording provided, which does not explicitly describe a fallacy in this case.

753,"Consider where they move. Migration patterns show people heading for warm states like Texas and Florida, not snowy Minnesota and Michigan.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of false cause (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc)
explanation: the reasoning here is that because people are moving to warmer states like texas and florida, it must be because they prefer those places over snowy states like minnesota and michigan. however, there may be other factors influencing the migration patterns that have not been considered or accounted for in this argument. this fallacy occurs when a cause-effect relationship is assumed based on the sequence of events without sufficient evidence to support it.",False
754,"This means it is possible that by some yardsticks, 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year.",nothing,"answer: slippery slope fallacy
explanation: the argument suggests a chain reaction where one event leads to another and another, with each event being worse than the last. in this case, the argument is that because el niño didn't vanish until the middle of the year in 2016, it might be declared as hotter than 2015. however, the connection between the two events (el niño not vanishing and temperature) is not logically necessary or definite, making it a fallacy known as ""slippery slope."" the argument implies that one small change will inevitably lead to a series of negative consequences without providing concrete evidence for this assumption.",False
755,Climate change will also reduce the number of cold days and cold spells. That will cut the total number of cold-related deaths.,nothing,"answer: nothing (or possibly circular reasoning, depending on the context)
explanation: while the statement does not necessarily contain a fallacy, it can be seen as an example of circular reasoning if the argument is that reducing the number of cold days and cold spells will reduce cold-related deaths because cold-related deaths are caused by cold days and cold spells. however, if the argument is based on evidence such as reduced mortality rates during warmer periods or increased mortality rates during colder periods, then it does not constitute a fallacy.",True

explanation: the argument relies on the claim that the u.s. is shattering high temperature records far more frequently than it is shattering low temperature records to support the idea that heat waves have become more frequent and intense, which in turn supports the idea that the u.s. is seeing correspondingly fewer cold spells. however, the argument is essentially saying that the increase in high temperatures confirms itself as evidence of increased heat waves and decreased cold spells, creating a circular reasoning fallacy.",False

explanation: the argument suggests that the high carbon dioxide emission from construction and maintenance of wind and solar facilities, as well as their reliance on coal-fired generators, is a causal factor in their overall emissions. however, it does not provide evidence to support this claim. instead, it assumes that because the facilities require support by coal-fired generators, they themselves contribute significantly to carbon dioxide emission over their lifespan. this assumption is an unwarranted connection between the wind and solar facilities' reliance on coal power and their own emissions, which makes it a fallacy of false cause.",False

Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of causality

explanation: the statement implies that the wet western winter caused the sky-choking summer, but it does not provide enough evidence or reasoning to establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the two events. a wet western winter could contribute to conditions conducive to wildfires in the summer, but it is not necessarily the only factor at play, and other factors such as heat waves could be just as important in explaining the sky-choking summer.",False

explanation: here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. the claim is that co2 levels are going up but not as fast as expected.
2. the justification for this claim is that ""the computer models just weren’t reliable.""
3. this claim relies on the assumption that the computer models used by experts were the only source of information or authority regarding the increase in co2 levels.
4. however, it's not accurate to assert that there are no other sources of authority or evidence supporting the increase in co2 levels or questioning the reliability of those specific models.

778,"Burning gas instead of coal in power plants reduces emissions in the short run, though gas is still a fossil fuel and will have to be phased out in the long run.",nothing,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents two options (burning gas or burning coal) while ignoring the possibility that there might be other alternatives (e.g., renewable energy sources like wind, solar, or hydroelectric power). it is a fallacy of false dilemma as it oversimplifies the issue and limits the consideration to only two choices when more options exist.",False

781,climate change will also reduce the number of cold days and cold spells. That will cut the total number of cold-related deaths.,nothing,"the reasoning provided does not seem to be a fallacy as described in the examples. it is a statement about climate change and its potential impact on public health. however, if we were to analyze it based on the logical structure of the argument, it could be argued that it falls under an 'appeal to consequences' fallacy (also known as 'argumentum ad consequentiam'). this is because the conclusion (reducing cold-related deaths) is not necessarily a proof of the truth of the claim (climate change will reduce the number of cold days and cold spells). instead, it assumes that the consequence (reduction in cold-related deaths) is evidence for the claim itself. but in reality, there could be other factors affecting the number of cold-related deaths as well. therefore, the argument does not logically follow from its premise to its conclusion. however, this is a gray area and it might not strictly qualify as a 'fallacy' since the reasoning is not necessarily flawed or incorrect, just less than ideal in terms of logical rigor.

explanation: the statement assumes that because gaia hypothesis is ""accepted as the founding principle of most climate science"", it is automatically an authority on the subject. however, accepting a hypothesis as a foundation does not make all its claims absolute truths or authorities on other related topics, especially when new evidence arises or different perspectives are presented. therefore, the statement uses a claim that may be accepted by many in the field as an authority without providing justification for why it should be considered such.",False

explanation: the argument suggests that both man-made climate change (which raises ocean temperatures) and the natural el niño climate pattern are equally responsible for the fish die-off. however, it does not provide any evidence or explanation of how these two factors interacted to cause the die-off. it is possible that one factor played a larger role than the other, or that they acted independently. therefore, the argument oversimplifies the situation by attributing the outcome to just two causes without providing enough information to determine their relative contributions.",False

explanation: the argument relies on the premise that carbon emissions will continue to track on a worst-case scenario to support its conclusion about the likelihood of ocean levels increasing by 11 feet. however, the likelihood of the ocean levels increasing by 11 feet is based on the assumption that carbon emissions are on a worst-case scenario. thus, the conclusion is being used as evidence to support the premise, creating a circular reasoning fallacy.",False

793,"The rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea.",nothing,"answer: nothing (there is no obvious fallacy in the statement as described, although it could be argued that there might be an implicit appeal to authority with the mention of ""experts"" and scientific findings, but the statement itself does not commit this fallacy.)",True
794,"Global warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities, but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016.",nothing,"the reasoning described does not seem to contain a fallacy as defined within the context provided. it appears to be a description of a process for making a decision collectively among experts rather than an argument with a flawed structure or reasoning based on incorrect premises. however, if we were to consider it in terms of a broader concept of fallacies, one possible analysis could be:

answer: appeal to majority (or consensus) - the assumption that because all experts come to a final agreement, their decision must be correct without question, not questioning whether their reasoning is sound or based on solid evidence.",False
795,Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called ‘sunny-day flooding’ — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years. The sea is now so near the brim in many places that they believe the problem is likely to worsen quickly.,nothing,answer: nothing,True
796,"The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link.",nothing,"answer: nothing (as described, this statement does not present a fallacy)",True
797,"As surface temperatures of the oceans warm up, the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere. We’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods.",nothing,answer: nothing,True
798,"We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.",nothing,"answer: false cause

explanation: the statement implies that the loss of forests each year is caused by people not appreciating them, when in reality, there are many factors contributing to deforestation such as logging, agriculture, urbanization, and wildfires. people's attitude towards forests does not directly affect the rate of deforestation, so it is a fallacy to conclude that there is a direct causal relationship between the two.",False
799,"Over the coming 25 or 30 years, scientists say, the climate is likely to gradually warm.",nothing,answer: circular reasoning,False
800,Some countries are already talking about banning the sale of gasoline cars after 2030.,nothing,"answer: argument from authority (fallacy type)
explanation: the reasoning presented suggests that because some countries are discussing a ban on gasoline cars, it is authoritative and therefore correct. however, this fallacy occurs because the claim relies solely on an alleged authority (the countries making the discussion), without providing any other evidence or reason to support the conclusion.",False
801,"In 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100. But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible.",nothing,answer: nothing,True
802,The planet’s average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F (0.9C).,nothing,"the given statement does not seem to present an argument or contain a fallacy, but rather it describes a hypothetical scenario involving experts making a consensus on a topic. therefore, the answer is 'answer: nothing'.",True
803,"Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.",nothing,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement suggests there are only two options for measuring sea levels (satellite or tide-gauge data), but it ignores other possible methods such as using both satellite and tide-gauge data together, or incorporating additional data sources like submarine measurements. therefore, more choices exist than just the two presented in the statement.",False
804,"And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.",slippery slope,answer: false dilemma,False
805,"Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future. And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.",slippery slope,answer: slippery slope fallacy,True
806,"Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.",slippery slope,"answer: false dilemma
explanation: the statement presents only two possibilities: either social security is made voluntary or it will not go bankrupt. however, there are other options, such as gradually modifying the system to make it more sustainable without making it voluntary, that are not considered in this argument.",False
807,because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.,slippery slope,answer: appeal to fear,False
808,"And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.",slippery slope,answer: false dilemma,False
809,"So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.",slippery slope,"the statement is not explicitly describing a fallacy. however, it can be analyzed as an example of a hasty generalization.

explanation:
1. the statement suggests that if the farmers' economy declines, then there will be a recession in the rest of the country.
2. this inference is not based on evidence or data showing a direct correlation between the two scenarios. instead, it makes an assumption that the two are closely related without considering other factors that could influence the national economy.
3. therefore, the statement is hasty because it draws a conclusion too quickly and without sufficient justification or evidence to support its claim.
4. if the experts were analyzing this argument in the given scenario, they would reach different conclusions due to insufficient evidence, which means they would not come to an agreement.
5. however, if we consider that each expert only writes down one step of their thinking, the statement can be interpreted as 'answer: hasty generalization'.",False
810,"The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.",slippery slope,answer: circular reasoning,False
811,"It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate. It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.",slippery slope,answer: false dilemma,False
812,"And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.",slippery slope,answer: false dilemma,False
813,"Now, you're -- and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money.",slippery slope,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents only two options (remain in a failing school or receive federal vouchers) when in reality there may be multiple alternatives not considered, such as improving the failing school, transferring students to other schools within the district, or implementing home-schooling programs. the statement creates a fallacious dichotomy that does not account for all possible solutions.",False
814,It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.,slippery slope,answer: circular reasoning,False
815,"If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children.",slippery slope,answer: false dilemma,False
816,"When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.",slippery slope,answer: slippery slope,True
817,The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.,slippery slope,answer: false dilemma,False
818,"If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.",slippery slope,"answer: appeal to consequences (or slippery slope fallacy)

explanation: the argument suggests that a specific action (not moving in southern africa) will lead to a negative consequence (acceleration of bloodshed). however, this is an assumption and not based on facts or evidence. additionally, the argument implies that there was only one possible course of action (moving), which ignores other potential options or consequences. the fallacy here is the use of hypothetical negative outcomes to justify a specific action, rather than providing solid evidence for its validity.",True
819,"If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa.",slippery slope,answer: slippery slope fallacy,True
820,If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped. That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.,slippery slope,"answer: false dilemma
explanation: the statement presents only two choices, continuing under mr. ford's policy or stopping it, when in reality there might exist other possible alternatives to address the issue of preventing nations from developing atomic weapons.",False
821,"He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation .  Now, here's what that means .  It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented .  And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country .",slippery slope,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents two extreme possibilities (massive law enforcement presence rounding up undocumented people and immediate deportation) as if they are the only options, when in fact there exist other alternatives such as a phased approach, providing a path to legal status, etc. therefore, it is a fallacy where only two choices are presented yet more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes.",False
822,"that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return. And that means war.",slippery slope,"'answer: false dilemma'
explanation: the statement presents only two outcomes (indicating that one won't defend an area will lead to war) without considering other possibilities, such as negotiation or compromise, creating a fallacy known as false dilemma.",False
823,"There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers. It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.",slippery slope,answer: appeal to fear,False
824,"This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.",slippery slope,answer: circular reasoning (the argument relies on the premise that the star wars system is dangerous to support its conclusion that going into it would add a dangerous new escalation.),False
825,"Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary. Here … are just some of the charts to prove it.",strawman,"answer: nothing (or 'no fallacy identified')

the reasoning provided in this statement does not appear to contain a logical fallacy as described in the examples given. the statement presents evidence (the charts) to support the conclusion that global warming is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary. while the reasoning may be questioned or debated based on the interpretation of the presented evidence, it does not rely on a misleading, biased, or incorrect use of logic.",False
826,"The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever. Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.”",strawman,"answer: false statement

explanation: while it's true that carbon dioxide is colorless, odorless, and non-toxic, it can still be considered a pollutant in certain contexts. carbon dioxide contributes to the greenhouse effect when emitted in large quantities, leading to global warming and climate change. moreover, high levels of co2 in enclosed spaces can have harmful effects on humans, such as causing carbon dioxide poisoning, a potentially fatal condition. the statement is false because it oversimplifies the complex relationship between human activities, co2 emissions, and their environmental impact.",False

831,Those who advocate for environmental protection are clearly against progress and economic development.,strawman,answer: false dilemma,False
832,You think that we should invest more in education? You must be suggesting that we throw unlimited funds at schools without any accountability or oversight.,strawman,answer: false dilemma,False
833,"My daughter's teacher says her class needs to spend more time on math tasks, she clearly doesn’t care about literacy subjects.",strawman,"the statement provided does not follow the format for providing a step in the thinking process as described in the example. it is presenting an opinion rather than a series of steps. however, if we interpret it as a series of steps, it can be seen as an argument from authority (appeal to expert), but with a flaw that the expert's judgment is biased or incomplete because they only focus on math tasks and ignore literacy subjects.
answer: answer: appeal to expert (with potential for bias)",False
834,Democrats want to spend more money on the social safety net. They are obviously communist.,strawman,answer: guilt by association,False
835,My friend says that he thinks he’s going to vote for the Republicans because he thinks they have a better stance on immigration. He is racist for even considering it.,strawman,answer: guilt by association,False

838,My boss says that I need to make more of an effort to turn up to work on time. Why must everyone discriminate against parents.,strawman,"the reasoning in this statement does not follow a logical sequence, but rather makes an assumption based on the speaker's personal situation (being a parent). it is trying to justify the speaker's actions by deflecting blame onto others, implying that they are being treated unfairly due to discrimination. this fallacy is known as 'red herring', as it diverts attention from the main issue at hand (arriving at work on time) and introduces an irrelevant factor (discrimination against parents).

answer: answer: red herring",False
839,"Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor. CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals”",strawman,"answer: false cause
explanation: the statement makes the false assumption that because carbon dioxide is odorless, colorless, non-toxic to people and animals, it does not contribute to pollution. however, this does not mean that co2 is not a pollutant in other ways, such as contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.",False
840,The teacher’s union argues that teachers should get a 4% pay rise. The school district says it can only afford 2.5%. The school district doesn’t care about quality education.,strawman,answer: appeal to emotion,False
841,"Americans are so patriotic, they must think they're better than everyone else.",strawman,answer: false generalization,False
842,"My dad says we won't go on holiday this year, he must not want me to have any fun.",strawman,"answer: fallacy of causality (or hasty generalization)

explanation: the argument assumes a cause-and-effect relationship between the father's decision not to go on holiday and the speaker's desire for fun. this assumption may be incorrect as there might be other factors influencing the father's decision, such as financial constraints or health issues, that have nothing to do with his supposed intention to deny the speaker's fun.",False
