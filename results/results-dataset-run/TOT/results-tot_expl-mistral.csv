0,"You have no idea how street is, you better stop talking!",ad hominem,answer: appeal to anger,False
1,Yes. People who disagree with this statement are obviously brainwashed by Apple and can not argue objectively.,ad hominem,answer: appeal to authority (false),False
2,"He is a good charitable person, so yes he does.",ad hominem,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of 'appeal to authority' fallacy, as the assumption seems to be that because the person is considered good and charitable, they must automatically do charity work, without any evidence provided for this claim.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it could be argued that this statement might not necessarily be a fallacy if there is additional information or context indicating that being a good and charitable person means that they are obligated to do charity work according to their personal values or beliefs.

step 3 (expert 3): upon further consideration, the final answer would be 'answer: nothing', as the statement does not necessarily fall into any of the previously defined fallacies. the argument might be based on an assumption about what it means to be a good and charitable person, but no clear logical flaw or fallacy is present in this statement.",False
3,"Of course, because then they will not become such an intolerant person as my opponent.",ad hominem,"answer: appeal to emotions (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)

step 1: the statement is attempting to persuade by appealing to a positive emotion (happiness), rather than providing substantial evidence in favor of the action.",False
4,"But think about the children he killed, they were laying in their own blood on the streets, eyes wide open. How can you talk to such a man?",ad hominem,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, guilt by association)

1st expert: this statement is an appeal to emotion because it's trying to manipulate feelings of disgust and sadness towards the person being discussed.
2nd expert: the mention of the children he killed associates the man with a violent act, which suggests that the speaker believes the man is inherently bad due to this action.
3rd expert: there is no reasoning or evidence provided to justify the association between the man's actions and his character as a whole, only an appeal to emotion.",False
5,The germans are all criminals anyway after the holocaust,ad hominem,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be an example of guilt by association, as it is suggesting that every german is associated with the holocaust and thus a criminal. the past actions of a group or individual do not necessarily define everyone within that group or individual.

step 2 (expert 2): the argument also appears to be an appeal to anger, using emotions of anger and resentment towards germans from the holocaust as a substitute for evidence in the argument.

step 3 (expert 3): moreover, the statement is utilizing circular reasoning by assuming that because the germans committed a crime in the past (the holocaust), they are inherently criminals today. the conclusion relies on its own premise to support it.

answer: circular reasoning and appeal to anger",False
6,"You are the antichrist, you want to destroy our belief in god.",ad hominem,"'answer: appeal to fear'

1st expert: the statement presents a claim without evidence or reason, and instead tries to scare the recipient into accepting it.
2nd expert: the claim is presented as if it were self-evident, but it is not based on any facts or evidence.
3rd expert: the statement uses fear as its primary motivator to get others to accept an idea (i.e., that the recipient is the antichrist), without providing any justification for this claim.
4th expert: there is no reason given for believing that the recipient wants to destroy anyone's belief in god.
5th expert: the statement presents a personal attack (i.e., calling the recipient the antichrist) instead of making a rational argument.
6th expert: the claim is not supported by any evidence or reasoning, and is based solely on fear and personal attacks.
7th expert: the statement does not provide any grounds for belief, and relies solely on fear to manipulate the recipient into accepting it as true.

the experts all agree that the statement uses an appeal to fear fallacy.",False
7,You're probably a drug addict yourself.,ad hominem,"the classification would follow these steps:

1st expert: this statement is an example of 'guilt by association.' the argument is that if someone accuses someone else of being a drug addict, they must also be one themselves.

2nd expert: however, the statement does not necessarily imply that the speaker is also a drug addict. it could be a general accusation or an attempt to discredit the other person without any real evidence.

3rd expert: the statement is an example of 'ad hominem' fallacy, which means attacking the character rather than the argument itself. in this case, the speaker tries to undermine the credibility of the accuser instead of addressing the substance of the accusation.

final answer: answer: ad hominem",True
8,Only people who are really dumb think celebrities get away with more crime.,ad hominem,"the first expert might say: ""this seems like an example of the 'appeal to anger' fallacy, as the argument is using emotions (anger) instead of evidence.""

the second expert might say: ""i agree with the first expert that this is an emotional appeal. however, i also see a potential 'straw man fallacy' as the statement implies that only stupid people believe celebrities get away with more crime, not that some people may believe it.""

the third expert might say: ""both previous experts are correct in their observations, but the final answer should be 'answer: straw man fallacy', because while anger is involved, it's the misrepresentation of the argument that takes priority as a fallacy.""",False
9,Anyone who doesn't want censoring must be a pervert.,ad hominem,"answer: guilt by association fallacy

expert 1: the statement is making an assumption that anyone who does not want censorship is similar to a pervert, based on the negative connotation associated with the term 'pervert'.

expert 2: this comparison between not wanting censorship and being a pervert assumes that all people who do not want censorship are like perverts without providing any evidence or justification for this claim.

expert 3: the statement is trying to associate not wanting censorship with a negative group (perverts) in order to make the argument seem more reasonable, but it does not provide any substantial evidence in favor of the conclusion that anyone who doesn't want censorship must be a pervert.",False
10,You are a criminal. So you should exit this discussion.,ad hominem,"answer: guilt by association

expert 1: the argument is based on associating someone being a criminal with the conclusion that they should exit the discussion, even though it does not provide evidence or justify why that specific person is a criminal.

expert 2: the arguer assumes that all criminals are incapable of participating in discussions, which is an oversimplification and generalization about a group.

expert 3: the argument infers that because someone is associated with the label 'criminal', they cannot engage in a discussion. however, many convicted criminals have gone on to contribute positively to society by participating in meaningful conversations.",False
11,"You have absolutely no idea, you probably never had a newspaper in your hand.",ad hominem,"the classification would proceed as follows:

expert 1: this statement appears to be an example of 'appeal to authority fallacy' because it assumes the speaker is an authority on the topic and thus their statement should not need additional supporting evidence. however, we should verify if they are indeed an authority before making a final determination.

expert 2: the expert confirms that the original speaker does not have any relevant credentials or expertise on newspapers, so it cannot be said that they are an authority in this field.

expert 3: since the statement lacks sufficient evidence to claim it as a fact and is based solely on an assumption of authority without proper credentials or expertise, i classify it as 'nothing'. there is no argument to analyze as the statement does not meet the criteria for any known fallacy.

final answer: nothing",False
12,"Extinction is not natural, you dont know what you are talking about!",ad hominem,"initial thoughts: the argument seems to be an attack on the person's knowledge rather than the validity of the statement itself.

first step: identifying the fallacy type - appeal to personal attack or ad hominem fallacy
reasoning: the arguer is attacking the person making the statement instead of addressing the statement's content, questioning their expertise.

second step: refining the classification - ad hominem fallacy subtype: abusive ad hominem
reasoning: instead of refuting the argument with counterarguments or facts, the arguer is resorting to name-calling and personal insults to undermine the credibility of the other person.

final answer: answer: ad hominem fallacy (specifically, abusive ad hominem)",True
13,"You are one of those liberals with long hair,  right?",ad hominem,"answer: guilt by association

step 1: the statement stereotypes a certain group of people (liberals with long hair) based on their appearance.
step 2: no reasonable evidence is provided to suggest that the characteristics of this group are bad or negative.
step 3: this stereotype is used to make a judgment about an individual (you, in this case), even though there is no evidence that you possess the same traits as the group being stereotyped.",False
14,"Everybody who sais, that global warning is no issue is a retard",ad hominem,"answer: appeal to name calling / guilt by association fallacy
explanation: the arguer uses offensive language towards people who disagree with their point of view. they are also suggesting that if someone disagrees with them on the topic of climate change, they must be unintelligent (a ""retard""). this is not based on fact or evidence, but instead uses emotional manipulation to discredit those who hold an opposing view. the arguer has also associated disagreeing with them on this issue with being a ""retard"", which is an association that does not follow logically.",False
15,"Why do you want a university-doctor's title to be shown on their identification-card? You must be one yourself, you egotistic prick ! Does it make you feel respected that we all know your little title?",ad hominem,answer: appeal to anger,False
16,Have you ever watched a movie? I think you have no idea of movies.,ad hominem,"initial response (expert 1): the statement seems to be an appeal to ignorance, as it assumes that because someone does not have personal experience with a specific topic (movies in this case), they cannot form an opinion about it.

initial response (expert 2): i agree with expert 1's classification of the statement as an appeal to ignorance. the statement is trying to discount the interlocutor's opinion by assuming that without personal experience, their view on movies is invalid.

final answer: answer: appeal to ignorance",False
17,"No, look at all the horrible things he is responsible for! You should not talk with such terrible persons.",ad hominem,appeal to anger fallacy. the reasoning behind this classification is that the argument is based on emotions of anger and hatred rather than evidence or reason.,False
18,You’re way too nervous about driving at night so of course you don’t want to drive.,ad hominem,answer: appeal to fear,False
19,"You are so damn soft and weak.  I guess you did never do sports, right?",ad hominem,"step 1: appeal to negative emotion (appeal to anger)
step 2: the statement is an attempt to make the argument seemingly reasonable by appealing to the position of emotion, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action. (appeal to positive emotion)
step 3: the statement also tries to distract from the truth of the conclusion by the use of negative emotions towards a person based on their perceived physical weakness or lack of participation in sports. (guilt by association, equivocation)
answer: appeal to negative emotion, appeal to positive emotion, guilt by association, equivocation",False
20,My opponent can’t possibly know how to balance a budget because she’s never run a business before.,ad hominem,"initial classification: appeal to ignorance (also known as ad ignorantium)

first step of reasoning: the arguer assumes that because the opponent has not run a business, she lacks the necessary skills and knowledge to balance a budget. however, this is an assumption and does not necessarily follow from the fact that the opponent has no experience in running a business.

second step of reasoning: the arguer infers that a lack of experience in running a business automatically disqualifies someone from knowing how to balance a budget. this is a fallacy because one can learn skills and gain knowledge through various means, such as education or mentoring, even without direct experience.

third step of reasoning: the arguer fails to consider that the opponent may have gained relevant skills and knowledge in other areas that are applicable to balancing a budget. for example, the opponent may have studied accounting, attended financial management seminars, or worked as a bookkeeper.

final answer: appeal to ignorance (ad ignorantium)",False
21,It’s hard to take your claims seriously because you spend your days playing video games.,ad hominem,"initial thoughts: appeal to belief (misplaced concreteness) or appeal to personality (ad hominem). the reasoning seems to be that the person's interest in video games implies they lack credibility or seriousness, which is not a valid inference.

second thoughts: appeal to stereotype. the assumption that playing video games equates to a lack of seriousness could be based on a stereotype rather than evidence.

third thoughts: nothing. upon further reflection, the statement does not seem to fit any of the classic fallacies as defined above. it might be considered an informal fallacy or a form of prejudice, but it is not a clear-cut example of any specific fallacy from the list provided.

final answer: answer: nothing.",True
22,Marx’s ideas are irrelevant today because the technologies we use and rely on would have been inconceivable to him.,ad hominem,"answer: appeal to ignorance (or appeal to lack of understanding)

step 1: identifying the claim - the statement claims that marx's ideas are irrelevant today due to technology.

step 2: determining whether there is a fallacy - in this case, we observe an argument being made based on the assumption that because something was not possible or known in marx's time, it must be irrelevant to our current situation. however, the absence of evidence (marx's ideas applied to contemporary technology) does not confirm irrelevance.

step 3: eliminating other options - since there is no fear being used as a motivator, no appeals to authority without justification, no comparisons to worse problems, no circular reasoning, no guilt by association, no anger being substituted for evidence, no straw man fallacy, no appeal to tradition, no equivocation, and no fallacy of division, the argument does not fit any of these fallacies.

step 4: identifying the correct classification - the remaining possibility is that the reasoning presented in this statement is an example of ""appeal to ignorance,"" as the conclusion relies on the unproven assumption that marx's ideas would not be applicable in our modern context due to a lack of understanding or knowledge of those ideas within the modern technological landscape.",False
23,Although Dr. Barone advocates for reducing our carbon footprints she lives in a large house and drives an SUV.,ad hominem,"step 1 (expert 1): hypocrisy fallacy - the argument is based on the inconsistency between what a person advocates for and what they do themselves, undermining their credibility as an authority.

step 2 (expert 2): tu quoque fallacy - the arguer is accused of being hypocritical to undermine the validity of their argument, but this does not necessarily mean that the argument itself is invalid.

step 3 (expert 3): since there is disagreement about whether this is a case of the hypocrisy fallacy or tu quoque fallacy, both are excluded as possible answers. the final answer: answer: nothing (as neither fallacy can be definitively confirmed based on the information provided).",False
24,Steve thinks Earth is flat so who knows what other crazy stuff he believes?,ad hominem,"steve's statement can be classified as ""guilt by association"". this is because it incorrectly assumes that believing one thing (earth being flat) makes someone an authority or representative for all their beliefs, which may not necessarily be true. the reasoning behind this classification is as follows:

1. steve's statement equates earth being flat with the person having other unsubstantiated or unrelated beliefs.
2. the assumption that a belief in one thing (earth being flat) implies beliefs in other areas (crazy stuff) is fallacious because it ignores the possibility of independent thinking or rationalization for each belief.",False
25,Your lawn is overgrown; you’re the last person who should care about garbage on the sidewalk.,ad hominem,"step 1: appeal to anger (emotions are being used in an argument rather than evidence)
step 2: circular reasoning (the argument relies on its own premise, i.e., someone caring about their lawn makes them a bad neighbor when it comes to garbage)
step 3: nothing (there is no other fallacy being committed in this statement, just two fallacies combined)
answer: appeal to anger and circular reasoning",False
26,you should be really stupid if you believe into such a thing.,ad hominem,"the first expert might write down: 'appeal to derogatory language' (using terms like ""stupid"" to undermine the opposing argument without providing evidence).

the second expert might write down: 'ad hominem fallacy' (directly attacking the person making the argument instead of addressing the argument itself).

the third expert might write down: 'nothing' (there is no clear fallacy being used, but rather derogatory language and personal attacks).

however, in this case, since all three experts agree that there is no clear fallacy, they would move on to a new statement.",True
27,Just because you would be a bad parent doesn't mean gay parents can't be good parents.,ad hominem,answer: appeal to fear,False
28,Im sure you have no children. That is the reason why you write something like this.,ad hominem,"the first expert might say: this statement seems to be an example of the 'appeal to ignorance' fallacy, as it assumes a negative conclusion (no children) based on lack of evidence or contrary evidence.

the second expert might say: however, the argument could also be seen as a form of 'circular reasoning', if it is being inferred that only people without children would write something like this, and then using the fact that the person writing this argument does not have children to support the conclusion.

the third expert might say: upon further consideration, i agree with the second expert's point about circular reasoning but would like to add that it could also be an example of 'guilt by association', as suggesting that only people without children are capable of making certain statements is a form of stereotyping.

the final agreement among experts: answer: circular reasoning and guilt by association",False
29,I guess you are vegan. You can see what it makes out of people...,ad hominem,"step 1 (expert a): this statement appears to be an example of ""guilt by association"". the arguer is implying that being vegan somehow makes a person less human, which is not logically sound or backed up by evidence.

step 2 (expert b): however, it could also be argued as a form of ""appeal to anger"", as the arguer seems to be expressing anger towards those who choose to be vegan.

step 3 (expert c): upon further analysis, the argument does not seem to rely on fear, false authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, straw man fallacy, appeal to tradition, equivocation, fallacy of division, tu quoque, or appeal to positive emotion. so, it seems the most accurate classification for this statement would be ""guilt by association"" or ""appeal to anger"", depending on which aspect you consider more prominent.

answer: answer: guilt by association (or appeal to anger)",False
30,Smoking must be safe because millions of people have been doing it for years.,ad populum,answer: appeal to tradition,False
31,Everyone is getting the new smartphone as soon as it comes out this weekend. You should get it too.,ad populum,"answer: appeal to positive emotion
explanation: the person here is trying to make the argument apparently seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.",False
32,"9 out of 10 dentists prefer our brand, so it is the best.",ad populum,answer: appeal to false authority,False
33,"The crowds at my Rallies are far bigger than they have ever been before, including the 2016 election. Never an empty seat in these large venues, many thousands of people watching screens outside. I am increasing in importance.",ad populum,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically appeal to positive emotion)

expert 1: the statement mentions that the crowds at the rallies are bigger than they have ever been before and that there are never any empty seats, which is an attempt to make the argument seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion.

expert 2: additionally, the speaker implies that the size of the crowds correlates with his increasing importance, further attempting to appeal to the emotions of those reading or listening to the statement.

expert 3: the statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning to back up the claim that the size of the crowds at rallies is an indication of a person's importance, thus relying solely on emotions rather than facts and logic.",False
34,"The majority of our countrymen think we should have military operations overseas; therefore, it’s the right thing to do.",ad populum,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the argument assumes that because a majority of people think something is right, it automatically is the right thing to do.
expert 2: but the conclusion was based on the premise that because a majority of people think something is right, it is therefore the right thing to do.
expert 3: therefore, the argument relies on its own premise to support its conclusion, creating a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared. (circular reasoning)",False
35,Three million fans can't be wrong!,ad populum,"answer: appeal to (false) authority
explanation: step 1: the claim that three million fans makes an assertion without evidence.
step 2: without any supporting evidence provided, the statement implies that those three million fans are experts or authorities in whatever subject is being discussed.
step 3: it is not reasonable to assume that a large number of people can be considered authorities on a particular topic without evidence to support this assumption.
step 4: therefore, the claim relies on an alleged authority with no justification, which is an example of an appeal to (false) authority fallacy.",False
36,"For such is the power true Godhead that it cannot be altogether and utterly hidden from the rational creature, once it makes use of its reason. For with the exception of a few in whom nature is excessively depraved, the whole human race confesses God to be author of the world.",ad populum,"answer: appeal to tradition

first expert: the statement suggests that the majority of people acknowledge god as the creator of the world, which implies that this belief is justified because it has been a long-standing tradition. this reasoning is a fallacy because what was accepted in the past does not necessarily hold true today.

second expert: additionally, the statement presents the belief in god's existence as being confessed by the whole human race, excluding only a few who are excessively depraved. this suggests that the majority of people possessing reason will inevitably accept god's existence. however, the belief in god can be influenced by factors other than rationality, such as upbringing or cultural background, making it an incorrect assumption to claim that everyone who uses their reason will acknowledge god.

third expert: finally, the statement implies that those who do not believe in god are excessively depraved, which is a negative judgment based on someone's beliefs. this is a fallacy known as guilt by association, where someone's character or actions are deemed negative because they share similarities with another person or group who has already been labeled negatively. therefore, the statement presents an incorrect and biased view of nonbelievers in god.",False
37,"If all that the senses present to the mind is sensations, Berkeley must be right — but Berkeley assumed this premiss without any foundation or any proof of it. The size and shape of things are presented to us by our senses, yet every one knows that size and shape are not sensations.",ad populum,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

explanation (expert 1): the term ""sensations"" is used ambiguously. in the argument, it can mean the immediate experiences derived from our senses, while berkeley uses it to refer to the mental images or ideas that those sensory experiences give rise to.

explanation (expert 2): berkeley's assumption that everything we know comes only from our senses and that our knowledge of size and shape is not a sensation contradicts his argument, since he has already admitted that our understanding of size and shape exists independently of our immediate sensory experiences.

explanation (expert 3): the equivocation fallacy occurs because the term ""sensations"" means two different things in the premises and conclusion, making the argument misleading or incorrect.",False
38,"This is not the type of book I would usually read — it's common knowledge, at least to very petite women who shop for the latest fashions in the children's section, that it's a world designed for guys. But oh boy, there's so much more to it.",ad populum,"answer: equivocation

step 1 - identifying an ambiguous term with more than one sense: the term ""world"" can refer to both physical reality and the subject matter of a book. in this case, it seems the author is using it in two different ways, implying that the book is for guys (physical world) and discussing the subject matter of the book (the world of fashion).

step 2 - determining if the argument is misleading due to the use of the ambiguous term: yes, the argument is misleading because the author is using ""world"" in a way that makes it unclear what they mean by stating the book is designed for guys.

step 3 - classifying as equivocation: the fallacy of equivocation occurs when an ambiguous term with more than one sense is used, thus making an argument misleading. this case fits the description of equivocation since the author is using the term ""world"" in two different ways to make a point about the book's content and audience, which are not directly related concepts.",False
39,"The Trump administration is being sued over its plans to include a question about citizenship in the 2020 Census, which California Attorney General Xavier Becerra says ‘is not just a bad idea — it is illegal.’ No, it's not. There is nothing wrong with asking about citizenship. Canada asks a citizenship question on its census. So do Australia and many other U.S. allies.",ad populum,"answer: appeal to tradition

1st expert: this statement uses the fact that other countries ask a citizenship question in their censuses as evidence that it is not illegal for the united states to do so. however, this does not prove that the practice is legal in the u.s. context, since laws and customs may differ significantly between countries.

2nd expert: the argument also assumes that if other countries can legally ask a citizenship question on their censuses, then it should be legal for the u.s. to do so as well. this is a fallacy known as ""appeal to tradition,"" where historical preferences of other countries or individuals are used as evidence that a practice is correct.

3rd expert: the argument also does not address the specific concerns raised by california attorney general xavier becerra about the legality of including a citizenship question in the 2020 census. it merely points out that other countries do it, which does not necessarily mean that the u.s. can legally do so under their own laws and constitution.

4th expert: the argument also fails to consider the potential consequences of adding a citizenship question to the u.s. census, such as undercounting non-citizens or deterring participation among immigrant communities. these concerns are not addressed in the argument and must be taken into account when evaluating the legality of this decision.

final answer: appeal to tradition",False
40,Some of you hold to the doctrine of States' Rights as applying to woman suffrage. Adherence to that theory will keep the United States far behind all other democratic nations upon this question. A theory which prevents a nation from keeping up with the trend of world progress cannot be justified.,ad populum,answer: appeal to fear,False
41,"The human soul is immortal, because all learned men agree that anything which does not come out of the potentiality of matter is incorruptible and immortal.",ad populum,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to authority (the agreement of learned men is used as evidence for the claim about the human soul)

step 2 (expert 2): equivocation (the term ""incorruptible"" has multiple meanings, and it's not clear which one is being used in this argument)

step 3 (expert 3): circular reasoning (the conclusion that the human soul is immortal because it does not come out of matter, and anything incorruptible and immortal does not come out of matter, creates a circular argument where the premise assumes the truth of the conclusion)

answer: circular reasoning",False
42,Why are so many people attracted to the Pontiac Grand Prix? It could be that so many people are attracted to the Grand Prix!,ad populum,"this statement is an example of circular reasoning. the claim relies on its own premise (i.e., many people are attracted to the grand prix) to support its conclusion that many people are attracted to the grand prix.

expert 1: the claim uses the conclusion as a premise, which is a form of circular reasoning.

expert 2: indeed, it does appear to be circular reasoning. no additional steps needed.

answer: circular reasoning",False
43,"I am one black woman who believes in America and loves this country, who believes that our future lies in Christianity, capitalism and the Constitution. And I am here to tell you that tens of millions of American of all backgrounds are with me — and are with President Trump.",ad populum,"answer: appeal to authority (false)

explanation: the speaker claims to represent tens of millions of americans, but there is no evidence provided for this claim. the speaker's personal beliefs do not automatically make her an authority on the beliefs of tens of millions of americans.",False
44,"We all believe such preachers as Mr. Raskin. He is so nearly right, his ideals are so very high, that most people assent — while they have no difficulty in evading them and going on their way as if a breath of wind had fanned their faces, and no voice of truth had stirred their spirits.",ad populum,"answer: appeal to authority (fallacy)

explanation step 1: the statement uses the preacher mr. raskin's opinions as an alleged authority on the matter.
explanation step 2: however, it is not clear that he has any real expertise or authority in the matter being discussed.
explanation step 3: therefore, his ideals cannot be considered as a strong evidence for anything without providing supporting evidence.",False
45,"International inspectors would monitor Iran's facilities, and if Iran is caught breaking the agreement economic sanctions would be imposed again. … Snapback sanctions? Everyone knows that once the international sanctions are lifted, they are never coming back.",ad populum,"answer: appeal to tradition

step 1 (expert 1): the argument refers to a historical event (the lifting of international sanctions) and uses it as evidence to claim that the same event will not happen again, implying that once a tradition is broken, it will never be followed again.

step 2 (expert 2): the reasoning assumes that the current state of affairs (international sanctions being lifted) will dictate the future behavior, disregarding the possibility of change due to new circumstances or decisions.

step 3 (expert 3): since the argument relies on the belief that a historical precedent will always hold true, it falls under the category of appeal to tradition, as the claim is based on past practices rather than on current or future evidence and reasoning.",False
46,"All the cool kids are skipping class. If you want to fit in, you should skip too.",ad populum,"step 1: the statement appears to be an example of ""appeal to social pressure"".
step 2: this fallacy is committed by suggesting that the listener should do something (skip class) because others (the cool kids) are doing it and if they don't, they won't fit in.
step 3: there is no appeal to fear, false authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, anger, straw man fallacy, tradition, equivocation, division, tu quoque, appeal to positive emotion or appeal to pity in the given statement.
answer: appeal to social pressure",False
47,"Of course climate change isn't real. The majority of people in our town don't believe in it, so why should we?",ad populum,"answer: appeal to tradition

step 1 (expert 1): claiming that something is not true because the majority of people in a specific location do not believe in it is an example of appeal to tradition.

step 2 (expert 2): in this case, the argument is based on historical preferences of the community, specifically that they do not believe in climate change, as evidence that climate change is not real.

step 3 (explanation for final answer): the fact that a belief is popular or widely held within a particular group does not make it true.",False
48,"All my friends agree that this restaurant has the best pizza in town, so we should go there.",ad populum,"step 1: appeal to authority (fallacy)
step 2: none of the friends are authorities on pizza quality; their opinions don’t make the restaurant an authority.
step 3: the argument could still be valid if there is supporting evidence for the claim that the restaurant has the best pizza in town, but no such evidence was provided.
step 4: absence of evidence results in nothing (fallacy)
answer: appeal to ignorance",False
49,You should buy this phone; it's the best-selling model worldwide.,ad populum,"initial thought: appeal to popularity (also known as argumentum ad popularem)

second thought: the argument does not necessarily imply that the best-selling model is also the best for an individual, as individual preferences and needs may differ from the general population.

final answer: appeal to popularity (argumentum ad popularem)",False
50,"Nobody in our circle likes that new movie, so it must be terrible.",ad populum,"answer: appeal to consensus (or appeal to popular opinion)

1st expert: the statement is based on the belief that because nobody in the group likes a certain movie, it is inherently bad. this reasoning assumes that everyone's taste in movies is equal and consistent, which is not necessarily true.

2nd expert: the assumption that everyone's opinions are equal ignores the subjective nature of art and entertainment. just because one person or group doesn’t like a movie does not mean it is terrible for everyone.

3rd expert: there's still an implication here that if the majority of people don't like something, it must be bad. however, this disregards individual preferences and taste, which can differ greatly among individuals. the fact that some people may not enjoy a movie doesn’t make it objectively terrible for everyone.",False
51,"I get mad when i think about all these poor guys on the street, having no home, no job, no family. All because they started taking drugs. Its so sad, we need heavier penalties.",appeal to anger,"answer: appeal to emotion (appeal to pity)

expert 1: the argument uses emotional appeal to make the conclusion seem reasonable rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.

expert 2: it is using pity to distract from the truth of the conclusion, rather than addressing the actual issue at hand.

expert 3: conclusion is based on emotions and pity, not facts or evidence.",False
52,Greece should be kicked out of the Eurozone! These lazy people and social system doesn't deserve support from hard-working states like Germany.,appeal to anger,"answer: appeal to negative emotion (appeal to anger)

53,"Definitely! They just misuse their fame, this inequity makes me sick!",appeal to anger,answer: appeal to emotion,False
54,Yes I would have air rage because of dumb asses with  a mouth and air in their heads like you.,appeal to anger,answer: appeal to anger,True
55,"Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction.",appeal to anger,"step 1 (expert 1): the statement appeals to emotion as the primary motivator for accepting an idea or conclusion.
step 2 (expert 2): however, it does not use fear but rather anger, hatred, or rage to make the argument seem reasonable.
step 3 (expert 3): therefore, the fallacy is 'appeal to anger'.",True
56,Are you tired of being ignored by your government?  Is it right that the top 1% have so much when the rest of us have so little?  I urge you to vote for me today!,appeal to anger,"initial thoughts: this statement seems to be using an emotional appeal (appeal to anger) to try and persuade people to vote for a candidate. however, it is not clear if there are any false claims or logical fallacies being made in this statement, so more information may be needed before reaching a conclusion.

step 1: expert a - the statement appears to use emotional manipulation as a means of persuading voters (appeal to anger).

step 2: expert b - however, it is not clear if there are any false or misleading statements being made in the argument. for example, the claim that the government has been ignoring people or that the top 1% have so much compared to the rest of us could be true or false depending on the context and evidence presented.

step 3: expert c - the statement does not seem to contain any logical fallacies such as circular reasoning, guilt by association, straw man, equivocation, appeal to tradition, or fallacy of division. it also does not appear to be using an appeal to fear, false authority, worse problems, or tu quoque.

final answer: answer: appeal to anger",True
57,How can you possibly think that humans evolved from monkeys!  Does my nanna look like a flippin' monkey to you?,appeal to anger,"answer: guilt by association

first expert: the argument associates a belief (humans evolved from monkeys) with a negative emotional reaction towards an unrelated entity (my grandmother).

second expert: the argument assumes that because a specific example of the belief (humans resembling monkeys) does not hold true, the entire belief itself is false.

third expert: the argument oversimplifies evolution by assuming humans are directly descended from monkeys rather than sharing a common ancestor with them.",False
58,"I have a few African-American friends who have gone through this horror and, you know, it makes me want to kind of hit the wall because it's such an assault on their humanity and their citizenship. We can't tolerate it anymore.",appeal to anger,"step 1: appeal to emotion (appeal to anger)
step 2: the argument is based on personal experiences and emotions rather than facts or evidence, therefore no fallacy classification is needed.
answer: nothing",True
59,People are fed up. They've had enough with the bickering and the partisanship that seems to characterize the debate that goes on in the nation's capital.,appeal to anger,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to anger)

expert 1: i see a strong emotional tone being used to persuade people, which is a characteristic of an appeal to emotion fallacy.
expert 2: yes, but more specifically, it seems that the author is intentionally trying to provoke feelings of frustration and anger in the reader with phrases like ""fed up"" and ""bickering,"" which makes this an example of an appeal to anger.
expert 3: i agree. the phrase ""people are fed up"" sets a tone of anger, and the use of negative words such as ""bickering"" and ""partisanship"" serves to reinforce that emotion, making it an appeal to anger fallacy.",True
60,The media is constantly spreading lies and misinformation to manipulate us. It's time to rise up and demand the truth!,appeal to anger,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to fear)",False
61,"How dare they try to censor our freedom of speech! We have the right to express ourselves however we want, and anyone who tries to silence us is a tyrant!",appeal to anger,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to anger)
explanation: the arguer uses strong emotional language (such as ""dare"", ""silence"", and ""tyrant"") to make the argument seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion of outrage, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of their claim.",True
62,Those protesters are nothing but troublemakers causing chaos in our streets. They need to be stopped by any means necessary!,appeal to anger,answer: appeal to anger,True
63,I'm sick and tired of these so-called experts telling us what to do. We don't need their condescending lectures; we need action!,appeal to anger,answer: appeal to anger,True
64,Flying cars will become reality because I have an technology degree and I say so.,appeal to (false) authority,answer: appeal to (false) authority,True
65,I heard a politiician on TV say that locking people up for drugs reduces crime.,appeal to (false) authority,"step 1: identifying the argument structure.
the argument is about the causation between locking people up for drugs and reducing crime.

step 2: identifying the fallacy type.
this argument appears to be a cause-effect fallacy, where the causal relationship between two events is not supported by evidence or reason.

step 3: checking whether it fits the definition of a specific fallacy.
the argument does not seem to fit exactly into any of the specific fallacies listed above. it is not an appeal to fear, false authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, anger, straw man, tradition, equivocation, division, tu quoque, positive emotion, or pity. the argument structure seems to be a general causation fallacy.

step 4: verifying agreement among experts.
the experts agree that the argument is a cause-effect fallacy.

answer: cause-effect fallacy",False
66,My nutritionist says we don't need meat to eat healthy.,appeal to (false) authority,"initial expert response: equivocation (the term ""healthy"" can refer to physical health and overall wellness, not just the absence of illness; the expert may be using it in a different sense than the arguer.)

second expert response: appeal to authority (the nutritionist is presented as an authority on nutrition, but the claim that we don't need meat to eat healthy could still be false without evidence to support it.)

third expert response: fallacy of division (it is not true that because some people can be healthy without eating meat, all people can be healthy without eating meat.)

final answer: fallacy of division.",False
67,"My husband says that eating meat makes you tired, so it should be true.",appeal to (false) authority,"answer: appeal to tradition (or fallacy of authority if the husband is claimed to be an expert on physiology)
reasoning step 1: the claim is based on personal experience (eating meat makes the speaker tired), but not on any scientific evidence or medical studies about the effects of eating meat on energy levels.
reasoning step 2: if the husband claims to be an expert, the argument would still be fallacious because there is no proof that this expert has done any research or study specifically related to the physiological effects of eating meat.
reasoning step 3: the claim does not take into account individual differences in people's responses to food and their energy levels. some people may feel more energetic after eating meat, while others might experience fatigue.
reasoning step 4: the argument does not consider other factors that could cause the speaker's tiredness, such as lack of sleep or stress.
reasoning step 5: even if it were true that eating meat makes some people feel tired (which is not established by this argument), this does not mean it is universally true for all individuals. the conclusion is overgeneralized based on personal experience.",False
68,"They are not suffering. I got a dog, i know what i am talking about.",appeal to (false) authority,"step 1: appeal to authority (the arguer claims they are an expert because they own a dog)
step 2: false authority (owning a dog does not make one an expert on the condition of others)
final answer: appeal to false authority",False
69,Nah my Dad says he treats my Mom nice so I know there isn't an issue here.,appeal to (false) authority,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be a form of the fallacy known as ""appeal to authority"" because the speaker is using their father's claim about his treatment of their mother as evidence, but the father may not be an appropriate or qualified authority on the state of their relationship.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it can also be seen as a possible instance of ""circular reasoning"" if the speaker assumes that because their father says he treats their mother nicely, then there is no issue in their relationship, and this assumption about the relationship is used to support the claim that their father is treating her nicely.

step 3 (expert 3): upon further examination, it seems that there is an overlap between ""appeal to authority"" and ""circular reasoning."" in this case, the father's claim is being presented as evidence for the relationship being fine, but the assumption about the relationship being used to support the claim that their father is treating her nicely creates a circular argument.

answer: circular reasoning",False
70,"No, i saw a video from a guy on youtube. Therein he presents, that the landing is completely faked. The state seems to have organized this in order to beat the russians.",appeal to (false) authority,"this statement exhibits an example of the straw man fallacy. here's how three different experts might arrive at this conclusion:

1st expert: the argument presented implies that the landing was ""completely faked."" however, it is not clear if the original argument made such a strong claim or suggested any level of manipulation by the state to beat the russians. this oversimplification and misrepresentation of the original argument are characteristic of the straw man fallacy.

2nd expert: the statement presents the idea that the landing was faked to boost national pride over the russians. however, this is not the original argument put forth by the video creator. instead, the argument suggests that the state may have played a role in organizing the landing. this distortion and misrepresentation of the original argument are indicative of the straw man fallacy.

3rd expert: the claim made is that the state organized the landing to beat the russians. however, it is not suggested that the landing was ""completely faked."" instead, the implication is that the state may have played a role in making it appear as if the landing were more successful than it actually was. this interpretation still aligns with the straw man fallacy because the argument has been oversimplified and exaggerated, leading to a distorted representation of the original claim.

the experts come to an agreement that the statement exhibits the straw man fallacy.
answer: straw man fallacy",False
71,Absolutely not. My father has always told me that you should not negotiate with dictators.,appeal to (false) authority,"answer: appeal to authority (fallacy)
explanation: the statement assumes that the speaker's father is an authority on negotiations, but it's not clear if he is actually qualified or knowledgeable about this specific subject matter.",False
72,"No. My best friend, who is an ecologist, says that all these ""global warming"" and ""melting ice glaciers"" stories are fictive. A global task force would be used for anything but protecting environment.",appeal to (false) authority,"answer: appeal to authority (fallacy)
explanation: the speaker is using the idea that a task force would not protect the environment as evidence against global warming, implying that because they think a task force has a different purpose, therefore their friend's claim about global warming must be false. however, this does not provide any evidence or reasoning for why global warming might not exist, and instead relies on an assumption that a task force cannot serve multiple purposes. additionally, the speaker's friend is not an expert in the field of climate science, so their opinion does not hold much weight as authority on the topic.",False
73,"I think homeschooling is a great thing, just go read some discussion forums and you'll find out yourself...",appeal to (false) authority,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)
step 2 (expert 2): the statement does not provide evidence or reason to support the claim that homeschooling is great; therefore, it is an example of argumentum ad ignorantiam (appeal to ignorance).
step 3 (expert 3): however, the argument is primarily intended to manipulate emotions (positive emotions in this case) to make the conclusion seem reasonable. therefore, the fallacy present is actually appeal to positive emotion rather than argumentum ad ignorantiam.
answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
74,Because Cristian said so,appeal to (false) authority,answer: nothing (as there is no argument presented for analysis.),False
75,My brother said Messi has won more trophies with Barcelona than he has with Real Madrid so he does not deserve the trophy.,appeal to (false) authority,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

1st expert: the term ""trophy"" could refer to various awards or honors, some of which messi might have won more with one team than the other. however, without specifying the type of trophy in question, the argument is ambiguous.

2nd expert: the argument also assumes that winning more trophies with one team than another means the player does not deserve an additional trophy. this reasoning equates deserving a trophy to the number of trophies won, which might not always be the case.

3rd expert: furthermore, the argument neglects other factors such as individual performance and contributions during the seasons when these trophies were earned. in other words, it is inappropriate to base an evaluation of a player's deservingness on just the number of trophies won with each team.

the experts reach a final agreement that the argument commits the fallacy of equivocation since it relies on an ambiguous term (trophy) and overlooks other important factors in evaluating messi's deservingness.",False
76,"Yes, ask the guys from PETA, of course they need special rights.",appeal to (false) authority,answer: appeal to emotion,False
77,My boyfriend has the opinion that Apple has only his profit on his mind. So Apple 's swift will be a fail.,appeal to (false) authority,"step 1 (expert a): this argument appears to be an example of the straw man fallacy, as it presents a distorted and exaggerated version of apple's focus (i.e., only profits) instead of addressing its actual position or actions.

step 2 (expert b): the argument also seems to lack evidence supporting the claim that apple swift will be a fail due to its supposed profit-focused mindset. this could be an example of the appeal to fear fallacy, as there is no justification provided for the premise that swift's failure is imminent based on apple's financial goals.

step 3 (expert c): the argument seems to make a conclusion about apple's future product without considering other relevant factors or contextual information. this may be an example of the fallacy of division, as it infers that a single aspect (profit-focused mindset) of a complex organization is representative of the entirety of its decision-making processes and outcomes.

final answer: answer: fallacy of division and appeal to fear",False
78,My teacher alwas took away our phones when we used them during class. I am sure he had a reason.,appeal to (false) authority,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be an example of 'appeal to tradition' as the teacher is using historical preferences (not allowing phones in class) as evidence that the historical preference is correct.

step 2 (expert 2): the reasoning provided does not justify the conclusion, as there might be other reasons for the teacher's actions. therefore, let us consider other possible fallacies.

step 3 (expert 3): the argument does not seem to use fear, false authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, anger, straw man, or equivocation. so, it appears we have identified the correct fallacy.

answer: appeal to tradition",False
79,My teacher said global warming is a myth so therefore there is no global warming.,appeal to (false) authority,"answer: circular reasoning

step 1: the conclusion (no global warming) is being supported by the premise (global warming is a myth), creating a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared.

step 2: since the conclusion relies on its own premise, there is no additional evidence or reason to support the claim of no global warming.

step 3: there is no new step because we have determined that this argument commits circular reasoning and no other fallacies are being used.",False
80,"Yes, yesterday i talked to my neighbour about it. She said that these celebrities can do what they want, because they are rich.",appeal to (false) authority,answer: appeal to authority (false),False
81,My mother says always that the non- European immigrans destroy our culture.,appeal to (false) authority,"step 1: appeal to fear (the statement tries to create a fear of cultural destruction, but does not provide evidence or reason for this claim.)
step 2: guilt by association (the statement implies that all non-european immigrants contribute to destroying the culture, despite the fact that individual actions do not define an entire group.)
step 3: appeal to tradition (the statement assumes that maintaining cultural traditions is more important than accepting new cultures, without considering the benefits of diversity and change.)
step 4: nothing (there is no additional reasoning needed as the previous steps already classify this statement as a combination of appeal to fear, guilt by association, and appeal to tradition fallacies.)
answer: answer: appeal to fear, guilt by association, appeal to tradition",False
82,"I read many facebook posts and comments from people who ""know stuff"".. you know.. behind the curtains... definitely experts... and they agree on that unanimously!",appeal to (false) authority,"step 1: given the statement, it seems to be suggesting that there is a consensus among certain individuals on facebook who claim to have special knowledge or expertise.

step 2: however, the use of the term ""experts"" implies that these individuals hold recognized authority and credibility in their respective fields. but, facebook posts and comments do not necessarily reflect professional expertise or official credentials.

step 3: therefore, the claim that these individuals are experts is questionable as they may be expressing opinions rather than facts based on their area of knowledge or expertise.

step 4: furthermore, the consensus among them does not guarantee that they hold valid arguments or accurate information.

step 5: since the statement is trying to establish the claim that these individuals are experts and there's a unanimous agreement among them, it can be classified as an appeal to authority fallacy because the alleged authorities in this case (the facebook users) lack the proper qualifications to support their claims.

answer: appeal to authority fallacy",False
83,"My friend said, that human dignity is more important.",appeal to (false) authority,"initial step by expert 1: appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion)
explanation: the statement attempts to make the argument seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion of importance, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the claim that human dignity is more important.

step by expert 2: no further steps necessary, as the initial classification by expert 1 accurately identifies this fallacy as an appeal to emotion.
explanation: the classification by expert 1 is correct, so no need for additional analysis.

final answer: answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
84,In TV they said celebrities are treated better.,appeal to (false) authority,"initial thoughts: the statement seems to be making a comparison between celebrities and regular people, implying that celebrities receive better treatment. this could potentially fall under the category of 'appeal to anecdote', as it is using personal experiences (in this case, what tv says) as evidence without providing any supporting facts or data.

second thoughts: however, if we consider that the statement suggests a generalization about all celebrities and their treatment, it could also be seen as 'appeal to tradition' because it assumes that celebrities have always received better treatment in society (traditionally).

third thoughts: on the other hand, the statement does not directly use emotions or fear to support its claim, so it's not an 'appeal to anger' or 'appeal to fear'. also, there is no obvious straw man fallacy as the statement represents the claim fairly accurately.

fourth thoughts: the statement doesn't use a supposed authority to validate its claim, so it's not an 'appeal to (false) authority'. it also does not compare the problem of celebrities being treated better with other issues to make the scenario seem better (i.e., 'appeal to worse problems').

fifth thoughts: the statement does not create a circular argument, as it doesn't rely on its own premise to support its conclusion. it also does not guilt by association, as there is no negative connotation associated with celebrities being treated better.

sixth thoughts: the term 'celebrities' could be argued to be used in a way that infers something about the whole (all celebrities) from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole (some celebrities), but this isn't necessarily a fallacy of division as the claim doesn't directly relate to individual celebrities or their treatment.

seventh thoughts: the statement does not use positive emotions to make the argument seem reasonable, so it's not an 'appeal to positive emotion'. similarly, there is no attempt to distract from the truth by using pity (i.e., 'appeal to pity').

answer: nothing",True
85,A good friend of mine explains day by dy why we absolutely should operate with military operations against the IS and he is absolutely right!,appeal to (false) authority,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to authority - the argument relies on an unspecified expert's opinion without providing any evidence or justification as to why this expert is qualified to make such claims.

step 2 (expert 2): circular reasoning - the conclusion that the friend is absolutely right is based on the premise that the friend is an authority, but there is no external evidence provided to justify that the friend is indeed an authority on military operations against is.

step 3 (expert 3): nothing - there does not seem to be any fallacy in this statement as it merely presents an opinion without providing a conclusion or argument to support that opinion. however, the lack of evidence and justification for the claim that the friend is an authority makes the overall argument questionable.

answer: circular reasoning (or nothing)",False
86,My husband says the musicians earn enough. Why pay them extra?,appeal to (false) authority,"answer: appeal to tradition

1st step: the statement implies that because a practice (paying musicians extra) has been traditionally done or not, it should continue to be so today. this is an argument based on historical preferences and not evidence or reason.

2nd step: the premise of the argument assumes that tradition equates with what is correct today, which is a fallacy known as appeal to tradition. if there are valid reasons for why musicians should be paid extra today (e.g., increased costs of living), those reasons would need to be presented rather than relying on past practice alone.",False
87,"My friend said that it is important for victims of disfiguration. Therefore, it is an important field of medicine.",appeal to (false) authority,"step 1: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to pity)
step 2: if a field of medicine is considered important because of its relevance to specific groups (in this case, victims of disfigurement), without considering other factors and evidence, it might be a case of cherry-picking or ignoring counterarguments.
step 3: since the argument does not seem to provide any counterarguments or balance the importance with other fields of medicine, and solely relies on emotional manipulation (appeal to pity), the final answer would be 'answer: appeal to pity'.",False
88,My brother said that he hasn't heard of this language before. It is obviously bad.,appeal to (false) authority,answer: appeal to ignorance,False
89,Did you read the Book from Jordan Belfort or watch his movie wolf of wallstreet? Money is everything. Economical growth means more money.,appeal to (false) authority,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)

expert 1: the statement implies that economical growth is valuable because it leads to an increase in money, suggesting that money is the only important factor. however, this is an oversimplification and fails to acknowledge other factors that may be important.

expert 2: the argument relies on appealing to a positive emotion (having more money) to make the statement seem reasonable rather than providing substantial evidence in favor of the conclusion.

expert 3: the claim does not provide any justification for the idea that economical growth leads to an increase in overall happiness or well-being, only that it results in having more money. this is a misleading use of emotion to make the argument seem reasonable.",False
90,My christian friend is says that every christian is against any kind of violence. I trust his words.,appeal to (false) authority,"answer: appeal to authority (fallacy)

explanation step 1: the arguer is using the word of their christian friend as evidence for their argument, but the friend may not be an expert or authority on the beliefs and actions of every single christian.
explanation step 2: this means that the friend's opinion about all christians being against violence does not necessarily reflect the truth.
explanation step 3: therefore, the arguer is committing the fallacy of appeal to authority by relying on an unqualified source as evidence for their argument.",False
91,"But many guys from my programming-course say, that only C is the real programming-language and that Apples Swift is for hipsters only.",appeal to (false) authority,"answer: appeal to tradition.

1st expert: the argument is based on historical preferences (c being the first mainstream programming language).
2nd expert: the conclusion is drawn from the assumption that past preferences should influence present decisions about a technology or programming language.
3rd expert: no disagreement, the argument relies on historical preferences of the people as evidence that the historical preference is correct, which is fallacious.",False
92,"I am working for UPS and my boss said, that this strike is not justified.",appeal to (false) authority,"step 1: identification of potential fallacy type.
step 2: determination of argument structure.
step 3: evaluation of argument premises and conclusion.
answer: appeal to authority (the ups boss being presented as an authority, despite the issue at hand possibly requiring a different kind of expertise)",False
93,Christiano Ronaldo deserves the the title as world's greatest soccer player because all the experts say so.,appeal to (false) authority,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to authority
step 2 (expert 2): the argument assumes that the authority of these specific experts is unquestionable, but there may be others who hold different opinions or have valid criticisms about their qualifications or methodology.
step 3 (expert 3): also, no evidence has been provided to demonstrate how these experts determined that ronaldo is the world's greatest soccer player.
answer: appeal to unqualified authority",False
94,Nuclear power was the reason of death of millions of people. It should vanish from this planet,appeal to fear,"step 1: initial classification by expert 1 (appeal to emotion)
reasoning: the statement is trying to manipulate emotions in order to make a claim seem reasonable, rather than providing evidence or logical reasoning for the claim.

step 2: classification by expert 2 (appeal to worse problems)
reasoning: the statement is making an argument better by comparing it to the worst-case scenario (millions of deaths), but that does not make the current problem any less important or relevant.

step 3: final agreement and classification
answer: appeal to emotion",False
95,"Yes, all the polar-bears are dying, and we are next.",appeal to fear,"the statement ""yes, all the polar-bears are dying, and we are next"" can be broken down into several parts, each of which may potentially contain a fallacy.

1. polar-bears are dying: this statement could potentially be an appeal to fear if the speaker is using the death of polar-bears to scare people into believing that humans will face similar fate, without providing enough evidence or reason to support this claim.

2. we are next: this part can also be considered an appeal to fear as it attempts to use the fear of impending danger (the death of polar-bears) to scare people into taking action without providing any solid evidence.

3. final answer: appeal to fear (twice).",True
96,"Yes, you certainly don't want your children to die from this virus.",appeal to fear,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be using an emotional appeal rather than providing logical or factual evidence.
step 2 (expert 2): the statement implies that not taking action against the virus will lead to children dying, but there is no justification or evidence provided for this claim.
step 3 (expert 3): the argument does not provide any reasoning or premises to support the conclusion, therefore it is a form of circular reasoning.
answer: circular reasoning",False
97,"When we go to war, we kill children with drones and kill innocent civilians.",appeal to fear,"step 1 (expert a): this statement appears to be an example of ""appeal to emotion"". the argument is trying to make a point by eliciting negative emotions (such as guilt or sadness) about the deaths of children and innocent civilians, rather than providing evidence or rational arguments.

step 2 (expert b): the argument also seems to be an example of ""guilt by association"". the statement implies that using drones in war is inherently wrong because they are associated with the unintended deaths of children and innocent civilians.

step 3 (expert c): additionally, the argument could be considered a form of ""straw man fallacy"". it presents a distorted, exaggerated or misrepresented version of the use of drones in war by implying that their sole purpose is to kill children and innocent civilians.

step 4 (expert a): lastly, the argument might be classified as an example of ""appeal to anger"" as well. the emotional tone and language used in the statement attempts to make the reader angry about the deaths of children and innocent civilians, rather than focusing on the facts and merits of the argument.

answer: appeal to emotion, guilt by association, straw man fallacy, and appeal to anger",False
98,"If people smoke at home they hurt their family-members, the one they love, through passive-smoke. It was such a shame if this was not illegal.",appeal to fear,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to pity)

step 1 (expert 1): the argument is using the emotional connection of family members and loved ones to make a conclusion about legality, rather than providing evidence or reason for why it should be illegal.

step 2 (expert 2): the use of emotional language such as ""it was such a shame"" further demonstrates that the argument relies on emotions, not facts or logic, to support its conclusion.

no further steps necessary since both experts agree on the classification.",False
99,"Yes, and that is why we do also have to censor the web. Think about all the brutality, which poisons our minds, all this porn that poisons the thoughts and relationships of our children.",appeal to fear,"the statement presents a fallacy known as ""appeal to emotion"" or more specifically, ""appeal to fear."" this fallacy occurs when an argument's premise is based on evoking emotions rather than evidence and reason.

expert 1: the argument attempts to sway the audience by appealing to their fears about the impact of uncontrolled internet content, particularly violence and pornography.

expert 2: however, this fear-based appeal does not provide any supporting evidence or rational justification for the conclusion that censorship is required.

expert 3: additionally, the argument oversimplifies the complexities of internet regulation and its potential consequences on free speech and privacy.

final answer: the statement presents an ""appeal to fear"" fallacy, as it seeks to influence the audience by invoking fear about the uncontrolled web rather than offering evidence or rational reasoning for censorship.",True
100,"For little children it is already enough if one cheats. they might get drug addicts as well. You have the choice, save children or drug addicts.",appeal to fear,answer: appeal to fear,True
101,Do you want to have a Hitler again? No? Then this Topic is not arguable.,appeal to fear,"answer: argumentum ad hominem

expert 1: this statement targets an individual, adolf hitler, and uses negative emotions towards him as a means to invalidate the topic being discussed.

expert 2: the statement implies that discussing the topic is equivalent to condoning or approving of adolf hitler, which is not the case.

expert 3: since the topic under consideration does not directly involve adolf hitler, using his negative image to dismiss the discussion is invalid and irrelevant.",False
102,"Test them, otherwise our children might get drug addicts as well.",appeal to fear,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to fear. the argument is using the fear of children becoming drug addicts as a primary motivator to accept the conclusion without providing evidence or reason.

step 2 (expert 2): nothing. there is no other fallacy present in this statement.

step 3 (expert 3): nothing. the previous expert's point about appeal to fear appears correct, and there are no additional fallacies evident in the statement.

answer: appeal to fear",True
103,We must keep Europe safe - these people are mostly muslim terrorist and they're going to overtake our country if we let them in!,appeal to fear,"this statement can be classified as ""appeal to fear."" the reasoning behind this is that the argument relies heavily on fear to persuade, not on evidence or facts. the speaker suggests a potential threat (muslim terrorists) and implies that if they are allowed into the country, it will lead to an overtake, which creates enough fear for people to accept the conclusion without questioning the premise.",True
104,"Me and my family have been living a peaceful life, so far. Everything is fine. I dont want sick black people to come and ruin my idyll.",appeal to fear,answer: guilt by association,False
105,Imagine you have a little child that dies because a drunken driver causes an accident. Now tell me you dont want to have that forbidden.,appeal to fear,"the first expert might say: ""the argument is using the emotion of anger, hatred, or rage as a substitute for evidence in the argument, which is known as appeal to anger.""

the second expert might say: ""the argument is also making a comparison to the worst case scenario (the death of a child) to make its scenario better, which is known as appeal to worse problems.""

the third expert might say: ""the argument also seems to be using the fact that a tragic event happened as evidence against something unrelated (in this case, not wanting the same thing to happen), which is known as guilt by association.""

therefore, the final answer would be: 'answer: appeal to anger, appeal to worse problems, guilt by association'.",False
106,"Co-ed schools... think about what this means. Young boys and girls together in a room, partly without supervision of a teacher. I would not want my daughter to get pregnant while school.",appeal to fear,"answer: appeal to fear.

step 1 (expert 1): the argument uses the fear of an undesirable outcome (girls getting pregnant) as the primary motivator for its conclusion (opposition to co-ed schools).

step 2 (expert 2): however, there is no evidence or reason provided to suggest that girls are more likely to get pregnant in a co-ed school environment compared to other educational settings.

step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, the argument overlooks the possibility of education and supervision aimed at preventing such situations, as well as the potential benefits of co-ed education for social development and gender equality.",True
107,If your mom or sister or friend and she was gang raped by a group of illegals wouldn't you want her to have the chance to have the baby taken care of?,appeal to fear,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to pity)

first expert: the statement tries to evoke emotions to make the argument seem reasonable.
second expert: the statement uses a personal tragedy to try and justify a policy.
third expert: however, the tragic situation presented does not logically lead to the conclusion of supporting a specific policy.",False
108,If you don't believe in Jesus Christ you'll suffer eternal damnation and torment in the afterlife.,appeal to fear,"the classification process could look like this:

expert 1: this statement appears to use fear as a primary motivator for acceptance, which is an appeal to fear fallacy.

expert 2: however, the statement also implies that not believing in jesus christ results in a specific punishment (eternal damnation and torment). this seems to be equivocation since it is using the term ""believing"" ambiguously - one could interpret this as having faith or simply acknowledging the existence of jesus christ.

expert 3: the statement also assumes that there is an afterlife, which requires belief in specific religious teachings. this can be considered an appeal to authority fallacy if it relies on religious texts as the only evidence for the existence of an afterlife.

at this point, all experts agree that the statement exhibits both an appeal to fear and equivocation fallacies and may also contain an appeal to authority fallacy depending on the basis for believing in an afterlife. the final answer would be: 'answer: appeal to fear and equivocation'.",True
109,Look I know it seems pricey but think about the safety of your family. Without this home security system you leave your loved ones vulnerable to break-ins and potential harm.,appeal to fear,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)

expert 1: the argument is trying to make the reader believe that buying the home security system is a reasonable action by appealing to the position emotion of safety for one's family.

expert 2: the reasoning seems to be based on emotions rather than providing evidence or reason for the claim.

(assuming both experts agree, no further steps needed)",False

answer: appeal to fear, guilt by association",True
112,Marijuana ruins lives and should not be legal- it can leave children without their parents.,appeal to fear,"step 1: appeal to emotion (appeal to pity) - the argument appeals to the emotional aspect of the listeners, using the image of children being left without their parents as a means to persuade them against marijuana legalization.
step 2: nothing - there is no evidence or reasoning provided to support the claim that marijuana ruins lives or that it directly leads to parents leaving their children.

122,If you don't buy this miracle anti-aging cream you'll look old and unattractive.,appeal to fear,"the experts would follow a process like this:

expert 1: this statement seems to be using emotional manipulation to influence the decision, which is an example of an appeal to anger fallacy.

expert 2: however, the primary motivator here isn't fear as described in the example, but rather the emotional response of shame or embarrassment. so, it might be more accurate to classify this as an appeal to negative emotion.

expert 3: you're correct that there is emotional manipulation going on, but it's not just negative emotions like fear or shame. the statement also attempts to trigger a positive emotion, the desire to look young and attractive, which could be classified as an appeal to positive emotion fallacy.

all experts agree: answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
123,If you don't enroll your child in this elite private school they'll fall behind academically and struggle to succeed in life.,appeal to fear,answer: appeal to fear,True
124,We should be working towards helping out planet and using natural resources.,appeal to nature,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an appeal to emotion, as it is trying to evoke a positive emotional response about protecting the planet and using natural resources responsibly. however, no evidence or reasoning is provided to support this conclusion.

step 2 (expert 2): the argument does not provide any justification for why helping our planet and using natural resources responsibly will lead to the stated outcome. this could be considered a fallacy of causation.

step 3 (expert 3): additionally, there is no explicit statement about the consequences of not following this advice. without that information, we cannot determine if there is an implied threat or fear-mongering, which would make it an appeal to fear. however, since the argument does not explicitly use fear as a primary motivator and the primary motivation seems to be emotion, i would classify this statement as an appeal to emotion.

answer: appeal to emotion",False
125,Yes humans destroy natural places for their own sake,appeal to nature,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to anger - the statement uses emotional language (""destroy"") that implies humans have malicious intentions towards nature, rather than providing evidence or facts to support the claim.

step 2 (expert 2): no further steps needed if we agree with expert 1's classification as an appeal to anger. if not, let's discuss and reach a consensus.

answer: appeal to anger",False
126,"Herbal medicine is natural, so it's good for you.",appeal to nature,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement uses an argument from nature, where a characteristic of something being natural implies that it is also good or beneficial.
step 2 (expert 2): however, the quality of herbal medicines can vary greatly, and not all natural substances are safe for consumption.
step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, some harmful substances may exist in nature as well. therefore, being natural does not automatically mean something is good or safe.
answer: appeal to nature fallacy",True
127,"Antibiotics are unnatural, so they’re bad for you.",appeal to nature,"answer: appeal to false authority
step 1: the statement claims that antibiotics being ""unnatural"" makes them inherently bad. this implies that the source of this claim is an expert in determining whether something is good or bad based on its naturalness, but no such authoritative source exists.
step 2: there is no scientific consensus that all unnatural things are harmful, and many beneficial substances have been derived from nature. therefore, the claim cannot be supported by a legitimate authority on the matter.
step 3: there is also no evidence provided to support the claim that antibiotics being unnatural directly correlates with them being bad for you.
step 4: the implication that all unnatural things are inherently bad is an oversimplification and misrepresentation of the facts, as there are many examples of beneficial unnatural substances and processes.
final agreement: answer: appeal to false authority",False
128,"Herbal medicine is more natural than antibiotics, so it’s better for you.",appeal to nature,"step 1: appeal to nature fallacy (appeal to naturalness)
step 2: the argument assumes that what's natural is inherently better without any supporting evidence or reason.
step 3: natural does not necessarily mean safer or more effective, especially when it comes to medical treatments.
answer: appeal to nature fallacy",True
129,How could something so natural as the sun cause skin cancer?,appeal to nature,"answer: appeal to tradition

step 1: the argument is making a causal claim that ""something so natural"" (sun) can be harmful (cause skin cancer).

step 2: however, it does not provide any reasoning or evidence to support this claim beyond the claim itself being based on the traditional understanding of sun exposure as potentially harmful.

step 3: the argument does not take into account modern scientific knowledge and research that has shown the specific mechanisms by which the sun can cause skin cancer (uv radiation). therefore, it relies on outdated beliefs rather than evidence or reason to make its claim.

step 4: this is an example of the fallacy of appeal to tradition, where historical preferences are used as evidence that the traditional understanding is correct, even though modern knowledge has shown this to be incorrect.",False
130,Genome editing must be stopped; it intervenes with the work of nature.,appeal to nature,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of the fallacy known as ""appeal to nature"". the argument is that because genome editing interferes with the natural order, it should be stopped. however, the fact that something is 'natural' does not inherently make it good or right.

step 2 (expert 2): furthermore, this statement also contains an element of ""circular reasoning"". the conclusion that genome editing should be stopped because it interferes with nature assumes that nature itself is perfect and untouchable, which is the very claim that needs to be proven.

step 3 (expert 3): finally, we can see that this argument also uses an ""appeal to emotion"" fallacy by tapping into people's feelings about the sanctity of 'nature'. emotions should not serve as a foundation for logical reasoning in scientific discussions like this.

answer: appeal to nature, circular reasoning, appeal to emotion.",True
131,"Mushrooms are healthy and safe to pick; after all, they are grown exactly as nature intended.",appeal to nature,"answer: appeal to nature fallacy
explanation (expert 1): the argument assumes that because mushrooms grow naturally, they must be healthy and safe. this is a flawed assumption as many toxic mushrooms also grow in the wild.
explanation (expert 2): the conclusion is based on the premise that something grown naturally is inherently good or safe, which is not necessarily true.
explanation (expert 3): the argument overlooks the fact that human intervention (selective breeding, cultivation) can have a significant impact on the safety and health of mushrooms.",True
132,"Animals have gone extinct all the time for millions of years; it is simply how evolution and nature works. Therefore, we shouldn’t make any effort to preserve endangered animal species.",appeal to nature,"step 1: appeal to tradition (argument uses historical preference of animals going extinct as evidence that no action should be taken).
step 2: false (historical preference does not determine what should be done today).
step 3: circular reasoning (the argument relies on the premise that nature works this way, which is the same as saying we shouldn’t make an effort to preserve endangered species because nature doesn't care about conservation).
step 4: false (nature does not equal human actions; humans can and should take action to preserve endangered species).
answer: circular reasoning and appeal to tradition",False
133,"ou must refuse to take any man-made medicines, they’ll harm you more than anything else. Instead, you should take natural ones, such as herbal medicine.",appeal to nature,"step 1: appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion) - the statement is trying to make the argument apparently seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of taking natural medicines over man-made ones.

step 2: nothing - there is no other fallacy being used here.

answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
134,"Cocaine is all natural; therefore, it is good for you.",appeal to nature,"answer: appeal to false authority (and possibly appeal to tradition)
explanation: the statement suggests that because cocaine is ""all natural"", it is good for you. however, this premise is not supported by any relevant expertise or authoritative evidence. additionally, the idea that something being ""natural"" equates to safety or goodness can be seen as an appeal to tradition, where historical beliefs about what is safe or healthy are used as justification. in this case, the harmful effects of cocaine have long been understood and documented by medical and scientific communities.",False
135,It's okay to lie - it's only natural.,appeal to nature,"answer: appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion)

explanation step 1: the statement attempts to manipulate the emotions of a person, in this case, by appealing to the position of happiness.
explanation step 2: the attempt is made to make the argument seem reasonable by appealing to the positive direction of emotions rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.",False
136,"Herbal supplements are derived from plants, so they’re safer than prescription drugs.",appeal to nature,"step 1 (expert 1): this argument is an example of the fallacy of equivocation, as the term ""safe"" is being used ambiguously to refer both to natural origin and lack of negative effects.

step 2 (expert 2): the argument also falls under the fallacy of appeal to tradition, because it assumes that something's natural origin makes it inherently safer without considering other factors like potency, dosage, etc.

step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, the argument implies that prescription drugs are not derived from plants or nature, which is incorrect. this can be considered a straw man fallacy because the arguer has misrepresented prescription drugs as synthetic and unnatural.

final answer: answer: appeal to tradition, straw man fallacy, fallacy of equivocation",False
137,"As your elected representative, I must emphasize the dangers of vaccination. They contain synthetic substances.",appeal to nature,answer: appeal to fear,False
138,"The problem with today’s children is social media. Children should play outside instead of looking at a screen. It’s the way humans have always experienced childhood, surrounded by nature.",appeal to nature,"answer: appeal to tradition
explanation: the argument assumes that the traditional method of experiencing childhood (surrounded by nature) is superior and should be maintained without considering the benefits or drawbacks of modern technology such as social media.",False
139,"According to the Theory of Evolution, the best creatures will survive. Therefore, we shouldn't make special efforts to feed the poor. If they don't survive, that just means they weren't as fit as we are.",appeal to nature,"answer: appeal to false authority (in this case, the term ""best creatures"" is being used without any evidence or reason provided to support it, making an unjustified claim about a scientific theory)",False
140,"There have always been wars. Hence, there is no reason for you to object that our bombing of Syria would be morally wrong.",appeal to nature,"initial step by expert 1: appeal to tradition (fallacy) - the argument uses historical preferences as evidence that the historical preference is correct, which does not guarantee moral rightness in the present context.

initial step by expert 2: fallacy of division (fallacy) - the size of a house (whole) does not imply that its doors' sizes (parts) will have the same proportion.

final step by both experts: answer: fallacy of division (fallacy of division and appeal to tradition combined) - the argument uses historical preferences as evidence for present actions, while also assuming that the size of a house implies the size of its doors, which is not supported by facts.",False
141,Eating raw fruits and vegetables is always better than cooked food because it's how humans originally ate.,appeal to nature,"step 1: appeal to tradition

final answer: appeal to tradition and fallacy of division",False
142,Using essential oils instead of manufactured perfumes is healthier because they come directly from plants.,appeal to nature,"answer: appeal to nature fallacy

expert 1: this argument assumes that something found in nature is inherently better than something made artificially, which is not necessarily true.

expert 2: the claim does not provide any evidence or reason for why essential oils are healthier, only that they come from plants.

expert 3: additionally, the argument ignores the potential harmful effects of essential oils and the possibility of negative reactions to them, which could be avoided by using manufactured perfumes instead.",True
143,It's better to drink untreated spring water than filtered or bottled water because it’s closer to its original state.,appeal to nature,"answer: fallacy of equivocation
explanation: the term ""original state"" is ambiguous. in the context, it seems to refer to a pristine, unaltered state. however, this interpretation would suggest that all treatment, even simple filtration, is harmful. a more accurate interpretation might be that bottled water has undergone some processing or treatment, while spring water has not. but this interpretation doesn't support the conclusion that spring water is better; it only says they are different in one respect.",False
144,"Our ancestors didn’t use sunscreen, so we shouldn’t either; it’s better to be exposed to sunlight without any protection.",appeal to nature,"answer: fallacy of appeal to tradition

explanation step 1: the argument uses historical preferences (our ancestors not using sunscreen) as evidence that the practice is correct today.
explanation step 2: however, just because it was acceptable in the past does not mean it is acceptable now.
explanation step 3: therefore, the argument uses tradition to support its conclusion, which is a fallacy of appeal to tradition.",False

146,It's best to avoid processed foods altogether because they don’t resemble what early humans ate.,appeal to nature,"step 1: appeal to tradition (using the eating habits of early humans as a justification for current dietary choices)
step 2: equivocation (assuming that ""early humans"" refers to the exact same dietary preferences and restrictions as those in modern humanity, which is not accurate)
step 3: nothing (no further steps needed as the initial assumption is already fallacious)
answer: appeal to tradition / equivocation",False
147,Meditation in the forest is more effective than practicing in a city apartment because it aligns more with how humans are meant to relax.,appeal to nature,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement suggests that meditation in the forest is inherently better due to its environment, which implies a connection to nature and human biology. however, this does not provide evidence or reason for this claim, only an assumption about human biology based on popular belief. therefore, it appears to be an 'appeal to emotion'.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement suggests that the environment of meditation is what makes it more effective, but this does not account for individual differences in people's response to environments. this could lead one to assume that there is a universal human reaction to certain environments when there may be variability in responses among individuals. so, the argument seems to be 'appeal to tradition' in suggesting that there is one ideal way to meditate, disregarding individual differences.

step 3 (expert 3): the statement argues for meditation in a forest as being more effective than practicing in a city apartment without considering other factors such as the quality of instruction, level of distraction, personal comfort, and so on. this suggests that the argument is based solely on the environment, disregarding other important aspects that could impact the effectiveness of meditation. therefore, it appears to be 'fallacy of division' in assuming that one aspect (environment) is responsible for the entire outcome (effectiveness of meditation).

final answer: fallacy of division",False
148,Fermented foods are inherently better for your health since they have been consumed for centuries.,appeal to nature,"step 1: appeal to tradition
step 2: fallacy of division (inferring that something is true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole)
answer: fallacy of division",False
149,Eating meat from wild animals is healthier than eating farm-raised meat because it’s closer to what was originally available.,appeal to nature,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be using the 'appeal to tradition' fallacy, as it suggests that because something was historically available, it must be better or healthier today.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it is not explicitly stated that farm-raised meat has been a traditional food source for humans throughout history. thus, the argument could also potentially use 'equivocation' by conflating historical availability with current dietary recommendations.

step 3 (expert 3): upon further examination, the statement does not seem to be making an explicit appeal to fear or anger, and there is no clear association being made between eating wild animals and other negative qualities. the argument also does not appear to be a straw man fallacy, as the position being argued against (farm-raised meat) is accurately represented in the argument itself.

step 4 (expert 1): upon reflection, it seems that the 'equivocation' possibility identified earlier may have been unfounded, as the argument does not explicitly compare historical availability with current dietary recommendations.

step 5 (expert 2): the statement does not seem to rely on authority for its support, nor is there an attempt to make a scenario better by comparing it to a worse problem. there also appears to be no circular reasoning in the argument.

step 6 (expert 3): after careful consideration, there seems to be no 'guilt by association' or 'appeal to positive emotion' fallacies present in the statement either.

answer: nothing",False
150,Breastfeeding is always superior to formula feeding because it’s how babies have been fed throughout human history.,appeal to nature,"initial thoughts:
1. appeal to tradition (using historical preferences of the people, in this case, humans, as evidence that the historical preference is correct)
2. fallacy of division (inferring that something is true of one or more of the parts from the fact that it is true of the whole)

final answer: answer: appeal to tradition and fallacy of division",False
151,You cannot send them back. They will be so sad.,appeal to pity,"in this scenario, the experts would start by analyzing the given statement and identifying a possible fallacy. let's say the first expert identifies the fallacy as 'appeal to fear.' here is how their reasoning might look:

1st expert (identifying the fallacy): the argument uses fear of an uncertain event (the collapsed economy) to justify an action (bailing out the automakers). however, there is no evidence or reason provided for the claim that if we don't bail out the big automakers, the us economy will collapse.

now, the second expert would continue the analysis:

2nd expert (continuing the analysis): the argument does not provide any logical or empirical support for its premise, making it a fallacy. specifically, this is an example of 'appeal to fear' because the fear of a collapsed economy is being used as the primary motivator without justification.

finally, the third expert would verify and confirm the analysis:

3rd expert (verifying and confirming): i agree with the previous two experts that this argument uses fear without justification to justify an action, making it a fallacy of 'appeal to fear.' there is no evidence or reason provided for the claim that if we don't bail out the big automakers, the us economy will collapse.

at this point, all three experts have come to the same conclusion, and there are no disagreements among them. the final answer would be: 'answer: appeal to fear.'",False
152,"I respected my parents instead of watching tv, i talked to them. My children dont talk to me, that is so sad.",appeal to pity,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to pity)

step 1: the statement starts by mentioning a positive action taken by the speaker (respecting parents).
step 2: the statement then compares the behavior of the speaker with the behavior of their children (not talking to them).
step 3: the comparison is framed in a way that suggests sadness and pity, and is used to justify the conclusion.
step 4: however, it does not provide substantial evidence for why the behavior of the children should be changed based on the emotional appeal made.
therefore, the argument falls under the category of ""appeal to pity.""",True
153,"Yes, because only veganism prevents cruel slaughter or exploitation of innocent animals.",appeal to pity,"answer: appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion)

expert 1: the argument seems to be based on the positive feeling of preventing animal cruelty rather than providing evidence for why non-vegan diet is inherently cruel.
expert 2: additionally, the statement does not provide any rationale or justification for the claim that veganism is the only way to prevent such cruelty.
expert 3: furthermore, there are different ways to reduce animal suffering and exploitation other than becoming a strict vegan. the argument fails to acknowledge this complexity.",False
154,What if somebodys mother dies and the student is in class. Why can he not answer his phone? How can you be so heartless?,appeal to pity,"this statement uses an emotional appeal, specifically an ""appeal to pity"" fallacy. the arguer tries to manipulate the listener's emotions by suggesting they are heartless for not allowing the student to answer a call in class due to the death of their mother. however, the quality of the paper written has nothing to do with whether or not someone should be allowed to answer a call about their mother's death. the emotional manipulation does not justify or support the conclusion that the professor should change the grade based on personal circumstances.

final answer: appeal to pity.",True
155,These sweet gorillas would die in the wild. Predators are vile in their natural habitat and zoos only protect these sweet animals.,appeal to pity,"answer: appeal to emotion

1st expert: the argument is trying to manipulate emotions (in this case, compassion for the gorillas) to make the conclusion seem reasonable.
2nd expert: the argument does not provide any substantial evidence in favor of keeping the gorillas in zoos for protection.
3rd expert: the argument does not address why predators are vile or how they pose a threat to the gorillas in their natural habitat, thus ignoring relevant facts.

all experts agree: the statement is an appeal to emotion fallacy.",False
156,Women are the mothers of our babies. Why would any man hurt his beloved one? That does not happen.,appeal to pity,"answer: guilt by association

1st expert: the argument assumes that all women are mothers, and that being a mother equates to being an ""one-to-be-loved."" this conflation of two separate categories is fallacious because it ignores the existence of women who are not mothers, or men who may hurt those they love.

2nd expert: the argument then makes the assumption that any man hurting a woman (who is inferred to be his ""beloved one"") is not possible. this is a false generalization based on the initial fallacy of equating all women with mothers and mothers with loved ones.

3rd expert: the final conclusion that ""that does not happen"" is a statement based on the premise that all women are mothers and all men who hurt women do so because they no longer love them. this reasoning relies on both guilt by association (conflating motherhood and being loved) and false generalization (assuming all men who hurt women no longer love them).",False
157,"No - some of the people using drugs can't help themselves. Do you really want to lock them up? They need help, not punishment.",appeal to pity,"this statement appears to be an example of ""appeal to emotion"" fallacy. here's how we arrived at this conclusion through a series of steps:

1. identify the primary motivator in the argument - emotion (pity)
2. compare this with the definition of 'appeal to emotion': a fallacy where an attempt is made to manipulate emotions, rather than provide evidence, in order to make the argument appear reasonable.
3. conclusion: the statement relies on pity to argue that drugs users don't need punishment but help instead. while it may be true that some drug users struggle with addiction, the appeal to emotion fallacy occurs when this emotional appeal is used to justify a conclusion without substantial evidence or reasoning.",False
158,All these children who cry because they get bad marks. Stop this!,appeal to pity,"step 1 (expert 1): this seems like an attempt to manipulate emotions (appeal to emotion) to change the behavior of the children, rather than addressing the root cause of their issue.

step 2 (expert 2): the arguer is trying to guilt the children by implying that they are being unreasonable or weak for crying because they got bad marks, which can be considered a form of guilt by association fallacy since it implies all children who cry in this situation are similar to someone with negative connotations.

step 3 (expert 3): the argument also assumes that crying is the problem, when the actual problem could be other factors such as frustration or confusion, and telling them to ""stop"" may not address these underlying issues. the arguer might be ignoring the actual problems by focusing on an emotional response, which can be seen as circular reasoning if the assumption is that crying indicates a lack of understanding or intelligence.

final answer: answer: circular reasoning combined with appeal to emotion and guilt by association.",False
159,"Just think of the poor nurse, or firefighter cming home after a long night/weekend shift. And now they go hungry, just because nobody worked at the grocery store.",appeal to pity,"'answer: appeal to emotion'

1st step: the statement appeals to an emotional response (hunger) in order to make its argument seem reasonable without providing substantial evidence in favor of the conclusion.
2nd step: while it is true that firefighters and nurses work long hours, this does not imply that they are always too tired or busy to shop for groceries when stores are open. the statement oversimplifies their lives by suggesting they have no other options but to rely on others' goodwill.
3rd step: the emotional appeal is used to distract from the truth of the conclusion that if grocery stores don't stay open 24/7, these workers will go hungry. this is a fallacy because it does not take into account alternative solutions, such as meal delivery services or getting groceries before or after their shifts.
4th step: furthermore, the statement assumes that it's the grocery store's responsibility to ensure these workers are fed, which is an unreasonable expectation. this is a fallacy because it misrepresents the role and purpose of grocery stores.
5th step: the argument also oversimplifies the issue by implying that grocery store employees have an easy time meeting their own food needs, while overlooking the fact that many might be working alongside these first responders or in similar challenging roles themselves.
6th step: lastly, the statement does not take into account the economic realities of running a business, especially small, independently-owned grocery stores. it is unrealistic to expect these businesses to operate 24/7 without compensation. this is a fallacy because it oversimplifies complex issues and ignores important factors in making decisions about business operations.

all three experts agree that the statement uses an emotional appeal to make its argument seem reasonable, but they disagree on whether this is a 'fallacy of emotion' or 'appeal to pity'. they discuss their reasoning and come to the agreement that the statement uses both tactics, so 'answer: appeal to emotion' is the final answer.",True
160,Yes because the poor athletes who play in a fair way.,appeal to pity,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)
explanation: the argument is trying to make the conclusion appear reasonable by appealing to the position of positive emotion rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.",False
161,Sick people suffer so much from pain and other symptoms that they deserve to forget through the use of marijuana.,appeal to pity,"initial thoughts: the argument seems to be suggesting that suffering individuals deserve to alleviate their pain using marijuana. however, it appears to be an emotional appeal (appeal to pity) as the focus is on evoking sympathy for the sick people rather than presenting factual evidence or logical reasoning in support of marijuana use as a means of pain relief.

step 1: the argument uses emotions (pity) instead of evidence or reason, which could lead individuals to accept the conclusion without proper justification.

step 2: there is no attempt to provide evidence that marijuana is an effective treatment for pain relief in sick people, nor any logical reasoning as to why it should be used as a means of forgetting their suffering.

final answer: appeal to pity",True
162,Those poor people have suffered a lot on their escape. Now we even have to accuse them for things they didn't do.,appeal to pity,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to pity - the argument is attempting to distract from the truth of the conclusion by using pity, suggesting that the refugees should not be accused due to their difficult circumstances.

step 2 (expert 2): nothing - there is no fear being used as a primary motivator to accept or reject the argument.

step 3 (expert 3): nothing - there is no false authority used in the argument, as no alleged expert is being presented as evidence.

step 4: the experts agree on their analysis and come to a final answer: answer: appeal to pity",True
163,"If we would be in their situation, we wished that every country which has the appropriate military structure to help would really do that.",appeal to pity,"answer: appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion)

expert 1: the argument is trying to make the action seem reasonable by appealing to a positive direction of emotions rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.

expert 2: the person is using pity to distract from the truth of the conclusion.

expert 3: there's no factual or logical basis for the claim that if other countries don't help, the result would be a humanitarian crisis. the statement assumes that helping is the only solution to such crises, which may not necessarily be true.",False

165,"The world is our mother, it is a familiy-member. You would not want to hurt your mother, right?",appeal to pity,"step 1: the statement uses an analogy to compare the world to a human family member, specifically a mother.
step 2: the comparison implies that harming the world would be equivalent to hurting a family member.
step 3: this comparison is used as an emotional appeal to guilt the listener into thinking they should not harm the environment.
step 4: however, this analogy does not provide any logical or evidence-based reasoning for why the world should be treated like a family member; it only relies on emotional manipulation.
answer: appeal to emotion",False
166,"My uncle watched one of his movies and kicked his dog. Dogs should not be kicked, so his movies must be too violent, or don't you think dogs should not be kicked?",appeal to pity,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to pity)

expert 1: the argument is trying to manipulate the reader's emotions by using the dog being kicked as a way to make the conclusion seem reasonable. (appeal to emotion)

expert 2: however, the argument does not provide any evidence or reasoning that the movies are too violent, it only appeals to the reader's emotions about animal cruelty. (no new reasoning introduced)

expert 3: additionally, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise; just because someone kicks a dog does not mean their movies are too violent. (circular reasoning)

expert 1: agreed, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. the appeal to emotion is a fallacy that only manipulates the reader's emotions and does not provide any substantial evidence or reasoning. (final answer: appeal to emotion)",True
167,"If this happened to your own children, you won't like it.",appeal to pity,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be using an 'appeal to emotion' fallacy as it attempts to manipulate the reader's feelings negatively instead of presenting evidence for a reasonable argument.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement does not provide any evidence or reason, so it can also be considered an example of the 'argument from ignorance' fallacy.

step 3 (expert 3): the use of the phrase ""you won't like it"" implies that the speaker knows the listener's preferences and feelings, which is unlikely without prior knowledge. this suggests a 'false authority' fallacy as well.

answer: the statement employs both an 'appeal to emotion', 'argument from ignorance', and 'false authority' fallacies.",False
168,Milk shouldn't increase in price because some mothers can't provide breast milk and need to give milk to their children.,appeal to pity,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to pity)
step 1 (expert a): the argument is trying to make the conclusion (milk shouldn't increase in price) seem reasonable by appealing to a negative emotional reaction from the reader/listener, rather than giving substantial evidence or reason as to why milk should not increase in price.
step 2 (expert b): the argument is not based on facts or logic, but instead relies on evoking feelings of pity and sympathy for mothers who cannot breastfeed their children. this doesn't necessarily mean that the price of milk should not be increased.
step 3 (expert c): there is no evidence provided to support the claim that increasing the price of milk would negatively affect the mothers who can't provide breast milk, or that they are the only ones who rely on milk for their children. the argument is based solely on emotion and does not present a logical reason as to why milk should not increase in price.
step 4 (expert a): the conclusion that milk shouldn't increase in price because of pity for mothers who can't breastfeed is fallacious, as it relies on emotions rather than facts and logic to support the argument. this appeal to pity does not provide a valid reason for why milk should not be priced according to market forces.",True
169,"No! After exhausting training and competition, it is too hard to confront the poor athletes with stressful drug testing also.",appeal to pity,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to anger) - the statement appeals to the emotional response of stress and pity to justify not conducting drug tests.

step 2 (expert 2): circular reasoning - the argument implies that it is too hard because the athletes are under stress from competition and testing, but the implication is that the tests themselves cause this stress.

step 3 (expert 3): final answer: circular reasoning - both experts 1 and 2 identified circular reasoning as a fallacy present in the statement, thus reaching an agreement that the statement uses circular reasoning.",False
170,"No, please stop blaming these poor celebrities. They already have the problem that everyone observes exactly what they do. Im sure they are crying quite often because of the public pressure. If they committed a crime, public pressure would force the judges to imprison them immediately. Humanity is so cruel.",appeal to pity,"step 1: appeal to pity
step 2: the argument tries to use emotions (pity) as evidence in favor of the conclusion that celebrities should not be blamed for their actions. this can be considered a fallacy because it relies on emotional manipulation rather than providing solid evidence or facts.
step 3: however, it could also be argued that the argument is making an assumption (that public pressure forces judges to imprison people immediately) which is not necessarily true in all cases and may not directly support the conclusion about blaming celebrities. but overall, the focus on emotions can still be considered as 'appeal to pity'.
answer: appeal to pity",True

explanation: the person here is trying to make the argument apparently seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action. the phrase ""i’m sure you will be happy"" is not providing any factual basis for the conclusion that the ticket should be bought. instead, it is manipulating emotions to make the argument more appealing.",False

expert 3: however, the statement does not use fear but rather appeals to sympathy and sadness. this is still an attempt to manipulate emotions without providing substantial evidence for the argument's validity.",False
177,"Steve Jobs died, how can you offend him like that?  This question is not arguable if you have some respect for the dead. He was the best. Noone can compete with apple.",appeal to pity,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, an appeal to positive emotion)

1. the use of the phrase ""this question is not arguable if you have some respect for the dead"" suggests that the arguer is trying to manipulate the emotions of the listener to agree with their argument by appealing to a positive emotion - in this case, respect for the deceased.

2. the statement ""he was the best. noone can compete with apple."" does not provide any evidence or reason as to why jobs was the best, and implies that no one else can compare to him or apple products. this is a form of hyperbole which is emotionally driven rather than factually supported.

3. the overall tone of the statement suggests an emotional attachment to steve jobs and apple, rather than a rational analysis or argument.

4. since the arguer does not provide any evidence or reasoning for their claim, and instead relies on emotional manipulation, this is an example of an appeal to positive emotion fallacy.",False

182,"No, because all people are the same. You are not worth more than me, just because you are a doctor.",appeal to ridicule,"answer: guilt by association fallacy

explanation step 1: the argument starts by assuming that being a person equates to having equal value.
explanation step 2: the statement then makes a distinction based on the job of one individual (doctor) and uses it as a basis for their worth compared to another individual.
explanation step 3: this comparison is made despite no evidence or justification showing that a doctor's profession directly impacts their intrinsic value as a person.",False
183,Do you really think that people who delight us with wonderful music should live like the poor?,appeal to ridicule,answer: appeal to emotion,False
184,"You couldn't possibly buy that wile thinking about all the poor, abused people who were exploited to produce these things.",appeal to ridicule,"'answer: appeal to emotion'

explanation: step 1 - the statement tries to manipulate the emotions of the reader by introducing the concept of poverty and abuse associated with the production of the item. this is not directly related to the truth or validity of the claim made about the item itself, making it an appeal to emotion fallacy.

step 2 - while the use of emotion can be powerful in persuading people, it is not a reliable means of assessing the veracity of a claim because emotions are subjective and easily manipulated. in this case, the reader is being asked to reject the item based on feelings rather than facts or evidence.

step 3 - the argument does not provide any substantial evidence or reasoning that would support the claim that buying the item contributes to poverty and abuse, making it an emotional appeal rather than a rational argument.

step 4 - there is no attempt to use fear as a motivator in this statement, so it cannot be classified as an appeal to fear fallacy.

step 5 - the statement does not rely on the authority of another person or group to make its claim, so it cannot be classified as an appeal to false authority fallacy.

step 6 - the statement does not compare the situation being discussed to a worse problem to make it seem better, so it cannot be classified as an appeal to worse problems fallacy.

step 7 - the statement does not present a circular argument where the conclusion is supported by the premises, which are in turn based on the conclusion, so it cannot be classified as a fallacy of division or a tu quoque fallacy.

step 8 - the statement does not use a specific term to mean something other than its intended meaning, so it cannot be classified as an equivocation or amphiboly fallacy.

step 9 - the statement infers that one thing is true of the parts based on the truth of the whole, but this inference is not valid, so it cannot be classified as a fallacy of division.

the experts reach a final agreement that the statement is an appeal to emotion fallacy.",False
185,I like how celebrities are treated like non-celebrities when it comes to the law.,appeal to ridicule,"initial thoughts: the argument seems to be using anecdotal evidence (celebrities being treated differently than non-celebrities) as a basis for a more general claim about the law (all celebrities are treated like non-celebrities).

step 1: this appears to be an example of the 'appeal to anecdote' fallacy, where a single or small number of instances are used as evidence to support a broad claim.

187,"All these women who are unsecure because of their small breasts and big asses. Life would be so much better without these chauvinist-plastic-""MD's""",appeal to ridicule,"step 1: straw man fallacy
   reasoning: the argument suggests that all women with a specific body type (small breasts and big asses) are insecure because of their body, which is a distorted and misrepresented version of the actual position or argument.

step 2: appeal to anger
   reasoning: the emotional language used (chauvinist-plastic-""md's"") indicates that emotions of anger, hatred, or rage are being substituted for evidence in the argument.

step 3: nothing
   reasoning: there is no obvious fallacy of fear, appeal to (false) authority, appeal to worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, equivocation, fallacy of division, tu quoque, appeal to tradition or appeal to positive emotion in this statement.",False

expert 1: the argument is trying to sway the reader based on their emotions, rather than providing substantial evidence or facts about the qualities of gangsta rap compared to heavy metal.

expert 2: the emotional manipulation used in this statement is specifically trying to make the reader feel that they are ""hard"" and street-proven if they agree with the argument, rather than providing objective analysis.

expert 3: this statement attempts to persuade by playing on the reader's desire for self-identification as being 'hard' or street-proven, rather than offering factual evidence of why gangsta rap is superior to heavy metal music.",False
189,"Aren't you patriotic? If America wants to see him gone, isn't getting rid of him the right thing to do?",appeal to ridicule,"'answer: appeal to anger'

step 1 (expert a): the statement starts with a question that is emotionally charged, implying a need for patriotism. this could be an attempt to evoke emotions and potentially sway the listener's judgment without providing any rational argument or evidence.

step 2 (expert b): if america wants someone gone, it does not necessarily mean it's the right thing to do, as there should be proper justification and due process. the statement does not provide such justification, focusing instead on a vague need for patriotism.

step 3 (expert c): there is no mention of any consequences or potential negative outcomes related to 'getting rid' of the individual in question. this suggests an oversimplification of a complex issue, potentially ignoring important factors and nuances that should be considered before taking action. the statement can thus be classified as an appeal to anger, using emotions as a substitute for rational argumentation.",False
190,History shows that now it is a peaceful religion but converting half the world to it was by the way of killing people./,appeal to ridicule,"answer: appeal to worse problems

step 1: identified a statement that attempts to make a scenario seem better by comparing it to a worst case scenario.
step 2: noted that the statement implies that past actions of killing people were justified because they were for converting to a religion.
step 3: recognized that this argument is flawed as it does not take into account the moral implications and ethical questions surrounding forced religious conversion, especially when accompanied by violence or killing.
step 4: realized that the statement tries to make the scenario of peaceful religious practices now seem acceptable due to the comparison with a much worse scenario in the past.
step 5: understood that this is an attempt to justify actions through fear and comparisons rather than objective evaluation, hence it falls under appeal to worse problems fallacy.",False

the second expert might say: 'the argument also assumes that if the musicians give away their music for free, they will become rich.'

the third expert might say: 'additionally, it infers a negative connotation to the idea of being a hobo, suggesting it is something undesirable or shameful.'

with these observations, the final answer would be: 'answer: appeal to fear (the implication that if musicians don't make their music accessible for free, they will become hobos).'",False

expert 1: the argument starts with a statement of frustration or annoyance about a group of people. (appeal to emotion)
expert 2: the arguer then makes a claim that this group relies on the support of others, without providing any evidence or explanation for why that is the case. (appeal to negative association)
expert 3: finally, the arguer implies that those who provide this support are being taken advantage of, implying anger at those they feel are abusing the system. (appeal to anger)",False
196,"No, class is a place for good old teacher and student information exchange. Not this modern internet stuff.",appeal to tradition,"the reasoning process among the three experts would be as follows:

expert 1: this statement seems to suggest that there are only two options or sides: either supporting a concept or opposing it, while ignoring those who do not hold any particular stance on the matter. that resembles the 'false dichotomy' fallacy.

expert 2: however, upon further consideration, it appears that the statement itself is providing a false dichotomy by suggesting only two options – being with or against god. it overlooks the possibility of agnostics or atheists who neither support nor oppose the existence of a deity. hence, this can be classified as a 'false dichotomy' fallacy.

expert 3: agreed. the statement oversimplifies the spectrum of beliefs by creating a false dichotomy and ignoring a significant portion of the population that does not fit neatly into the proposed categories. so, 'answer: false dichotomy'.",False

step 1: recognize the argument's premise - for five generations, the men in our family went to stanford and became doctors, while the women got married and raised children.

step 2: identify the conclusion - therefore, it is my duty to become a doctor.

step 3: determine whether the argument relies on historical preferences as evidence that the historical preference is correct - yes, it does as the premise states that for five generations the men in the family have become doctors and it implies that following this tradition makes it the 'duty' of the current individual to do the same.

step 4: conclude the fallacy classification - the argument relies on appealing to tradition, which is a fallacy where historical preferences of people (tradition), either in general or as specific as the historical preferences of a single individual, are used as evidence that the historical preference is correct.",True

explanation: the statement is arguing that the issues mentioned (medicare, prescription drugs, social security, and education) have not been addressed because there has been ""eight years of talk but no action"". however, this argument relies on its own premise - that there has been no action - to support its conclusion that the issues have not been addressed. this creates a circular reasoning fallacy where the claim is supported by its own premise, creating a loop in reasoning with no useful information being shared.",False

step 2 (expert b): the argument is using the fact that other people are suffering to justify not addressing income inequality in the present context.

explanation step 3: the argument ignores the fact that addressing mental health stigma in one’s own culture can lead to improvements, regardless of how other cultures may treat mental illness. (improper comparison or ignoring relevant factors)",True
220,Stop being unhappy! There are people who have it worse than you!,appeal to worse problems,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to worse problems fallacy. the argument attempts to make the current problem less important by comparing it to a worse one.

step 2 (expert 2): nothing. this is not an explicit appeal to fear, false authority, guilt by association, circular reasoning, straw man, appeal to tradition, equivocation, fallacy of division, tu quoque, appeal to positive emotion, or appeal to pity. it fits the description provided for ""appeal to worse problems"".

step 3 (expert 3): nothing. agree with expert 2. this argument fits the description provided for ""appeal to worse problems"" and does not exhibit any other fallacies as described in the example.

answer: appeal to worse problems",True
221,Stop being unhappy! There are people who do not have it as good as you!,appeal to worse problems,"answer: appeal to worse problems.

explanation: step 1: recognize the attempt to make a scenario better by comparing it to the worst case scenario, which is the essence of the appeal to worse problems fallacy.
step 2: identify that the argument does not consider or address the importance of the current problem that makes someone unhappy, despite its potential significance.
step 3: confirm that just because there are people in worse situations, it does not mean that the current problem is not important.",True
222,Stalin wasn't as bad as Hitler.,appeal to worse problems,"step 1: comparison fallacy (appeal to worse problems)
step 2: no further comparisons are being made, so the next step would be to consider if there is any other fallacy involved.
step 3: there are no other fallacies present in this statement.
answer: nothing",True
223,"Barack Obama might be detaining people without trial and bombing civilians in other countries, but Bush did far worse.",appeal to worse problems,"answer: tu quoque

step 1 (expert 1): the argument is comparing the actions of two different individuals (bush and obama) without providing any evidence or justification for why one's actions are acceptable because the other person did something worse.

step 2 (expert 2): the comparison between the two individuals does not address the issue at hand, which is whether or not obama is detaining people without trial and bombing civilians in other countries.

step 3 (expert 3): the argument attempts to justify one's actions by pointing out that someone else has done worse things in the past, which is irrelevant to the truth of the current claims being made about obama.",False
224,"Yes, the US is keeping secret prisons, but we're not as bad as Saddam Hussein!",appeal to worse problems,"answer: appeal to worse problems

expert 1: the arguer is trying to make their scenario seem better by comparing it to a worse case scenario (saddam hussein).

expert 2: however, this does not negate the fact that the initial claim (the us keeping secret prisons) remains unproven or questioned.

expert 3: the arguer is attempting to distract from the truth of the initial claim by using saddam hussein as a negative comparison, thus making it seem more acceptable or reasonable.",True
225,"Women are stereotyped by the media, but it isn't as big of a problem as poverty, wars, or human rights in the world!",appeal to worse problems,answer: appeal to worse problems,True
226,"gun ownership shouldn't be restricted, because people driving cars cause more deaths than people using guns and we're not restricted from owning cars.",appeal to worse problemss,"answer: fallacy of false equivalence

expert 1: the comparison between two different things (guns and cars) does not show that one should not be restricted while the other is allowed.

expert 2: the claim relies on the premise that because there is no restriction on one item, it means there should not be a restriction on another. this is fallacious as they are not equivalent in any way.

expert 3: there is no logical equivalence between guns and cars; therefore, this argument is based on a false premise, which falls under the category of fallacy of false equivalence.",False
227,"Smoking may be a bad thing, but it's not as bad as car exhausts.",appeal to worse problems,answer: appeal to worse problems,True
228,"Sure, US forces tortured people in Afghanistan, but it's not as bad as what the Japanese did in WWII.",appeal to worse problems,answer: appeal to worse problems,True
229,Sexism and misogyny is not a problem in the Western World. Just look to the Middle East.,appeal to worse problems,"initial thoughts: appeal to worse problems fallacy, as the argument attempts to make a scenario (the absence of sexism/misogyny in the western world) seem better by comparing it to the worst case scenario (sexism/misogyny in the middle east).

second thoughts: nothing. while the initial reasoning could be considered an appeal to worse problems fallacy, the statement does not necessarily imply that sexism and misogyny are not problems in the western world, but rather it seems to suggest that the situation may be better compared to other regions. this is not a logical comparison or fallacy, as it could be argued that the absence of a problem (or the reduction of a problem) is an improvement, even if other areas still struggle with it more severely.

final answer: nothing",True
230,Be happy with the 1972 Chevy Nova you drive.  There are many people in this country who don’t even have a car.,appeal to worse problems,"'answer: appeal to worse problems'
explanation: the argument is attempting to make the scenario (driving the 1972 chevy nova) better by comparing it to the worst case scenario (having no car at all), which does not justify why having this specific car is not important.",True
231,"Yes, people talk less because they are too wrapped up in watching TV.",causal oversimplification,"step 1: identifying the claim being made.
claim: people talk less because they are too wrapped up in watching tv.

step 2: determining whether it is a fallacy or not.
fallacy type: appeal to causality (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc) - assuming that because one event follows another, the first event was caused by the second. in this case, watching tv leads people to talk less without evidence or reason provided to support this claim.

answer: appeal to causality",False
232,"Earlier this month, NASA scientists provided a visualization of a startling climate change trend — the Earth is getting greener, as viewed from space, especially in its rapidly warming northern regions. And this is presumably occurring as more carbon dioxide in the air, along with warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons, makes plants very, very happy.",causal oversimplification,"answer: appeal to emotion

expert 1: the reasoning behind the statement seems to be based on an emotional response (the plants are ""very, very happy"") rather than objective evidence or data.

expert 2: additionally, the implication that carbon dioxide in the air is causing plant growth is not directly supported by the statement itself. it is making an assumption without proper explanation or justification.

expert 3: moreover, the claim that warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons are the main contributors to increased plant growth does not take into account other factors such as precipitation, soil quality, etc., which could be equally important in this context. therefore, we need a more comprehensive explanation of why these factors are leading to an increase in plant growth on earth.",False
233,A sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity. People have become more sedentary in the last few decades. The rise in obesity can be fixed by people getting more exercise.,causal oversimplification,"this statement appears to commit the fallacy of causal oversimplification, also known as the ""fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc"" (after this, therefore because of this). the reasoning here is that because a factor has increased in a given time period, it is assumed to be the cause of another increase during the same time. however, there may be multiple factors at play or no causal relationship between the two observed increases. in this case, it is not definitively established that sedentary lifestyles are the sole cause of obesity, as other factors such as diet and genetics may also contribute significantly to the rise in obesity.

the final answer would be: answer: fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc.",True
234,Smoking has been empirically proven to cause lung cancer. If we eradicate smoking we will eradicate lung cancer.,causal oversimplification,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: smoking causes lung cancer in individuals, but it doesn't follow that if we eliminate smoking we can also eliminate lung cancer completely. (fallacy of division)

expert 2: lung cancer is caused by many factors, not just smoking. eradicating smoking wouldn't automatically eradicate all cases of lung cancer. (further explanation of fallacy of division)

expert 3: even if we assume that smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer, there are other forms of lung cancer that do not involve smoking and thus would not be affected by eliminating smoking. (final agreement on fallacy of division)",False
235,You see; it's simple. Crime rates are skyrocketing because of all these immigrants flooding in. They bring their problems with them and it's causing chaos.,causal oversimplification,"step 1: appeal to fear
step 2: guilt by association (implicit, as the argument is suggesting that immigrants are causing crime, implying they are inherently 'bad')
step 3: nothing (the statement does not contain any further fallacies)
answer: appeal to fear, guilt by association",False
236,Automation is the real culprit behind unemployment. Why hire people when you can have machines do the work cheaper and faster? That's why so many folks are out of a job.,causal oversimplification,"answer: appeal to false authority

explanation: step 1 (first expert): the statement attributes the cause of unemployment to automation, but it does not specify who this alleged authority is that claims automation is the culprit.
step 2 (second expert): this alleged authority is not specified, so they would need to know who is making this claim and if the source has a credible background in economics or employment statistics.
step 3 (third expert): since no credible economist or employment statistician is named, there is no evidence provided that automation is indeed the real culprit behind unemployment, resulting in all experts agreeing on the answer of ""appeal to false authority"".",False
237,I'm telling you - smartphones are ruining our kids' education. They're constantly glued to those screens and it's no wonder their grades are dropping like flies.,causal oversimplification,"answer: appeal to emotion
explanation (expert 1): the argument is based on an emotional response rather than evidence or reason, as the speaker is using a dramatic claim to create fear that smartphones are ruining kids' education.

explanation (expert 2): however, no evidence or statistics have been provided to support this claim that smartphones are the primary cause of lower grades in children.

explanation (expert 3): the speaker is not providing a causal relationship between smartphone usage and poor academic performance; thus, this argument uses an appeal to emotion fallacy by presenting an emotional narrative without any supporting evidence.",False
238,Have you seen the games kids play these days? It's all violence violence violence. No wonder they're becoming more aggressive. Blame it on those video games.,causal oversimplification,"initial thoughts: this statement seems to be using the emotions of fear (worry about children becoming aggressive) and anger (disapproval of violent video games) as the primary motivators to accept the conclusion that violent video games are responsible for children's aggression.

expert 1: appeal to emotion (as the argument is trying to manipulate emotions rather than provide evidence)

expert 2: nothing (since there doesn't seem to be any clear fallacy in this statement at first glance; however, let's explore further to find potential biases or logical flaws)

expert 3: circular reasoning (the argument assumes that if children play violent games they will become aggressive and the aggression displayed by children is proof that those video games are to blame)

now we have a potential fallacy, which can be further analyzed:
- the statement claims that children playing violent games causes them to become more aggressive, but it does not provide any evidence or reason to support this claim.
- moreover, the conclusion relies on its own premise (i.e., aggression in children proves they play violent video games), which creates a circular reasoning problem.

answer: circular reasoning and appeal to emotion",False
239,Our society is going down the drain because we're losing touch with our values. Everything's so different now and it's causing all sorts of problems.,causal oversimplification,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to negative emotion)

explanation: the statement aims to make the reader believe that something bad is happening by appealing to their emotions rather than providing evidence or reason for the claim. the statement is designed to evoke a negative emotional response (fear, worry, anger) from the reader in order to persuade them of its validity, which does not rely on evidence or reason.",False
240,Look at the government spending money left and right like there's no tomorrow. Of course the economy's in the gutter. It's overspending 101.,causal oversimplification,"initial thoughts (expert 1): the argument seems to be based on correlation, not causation. spending money does not inherently lead to an economy being ""in the gutter"".
initial thoughts (expert 2): the statement is using fear as a primary motivator to accept the conclusion, which is fallacious appeal to fear.
initial thoughts (expert 3): the argument is also ignoring alternative explanations for the economic state, such as external factors like global trade, natural disasters, or changes in technology, which could be fallacy of oversimplification.

discussion: it appears that both expert 2's identification of appeal to fear and expert 1's observation of correlation without causation are valid points. however, the argument does not necessarily commit to an oversimplification fallacy as it does not explicitly claim that all factors contributing to the economy can be attributed to government spending alone.

final answer: answer: appeal to fear (correlation without causation)",False
241,It's obvious isn't it? More divorces happen because men and women don't know their roles anymore. Once upon a time things were simpler and families stayed together.,causal oversimplification,answer: appeal to tradition,False
242,Globalization is killing off our industries. We used to be self-sufficient but now everything's made overseas. No wonder people are losing their jobs left and right.,causal oversimplification,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to imply that globalization is the cause of job losses in specific industries, but it does not provide any evidence or reason for this claim.
answer: appeal to fear

step 2 (expert 2): the argument assumes that all job losses are directly related to the fact that products are now made overseas, but there could be many other reasons for these losses.
answer: fallacy of division

step 3 (expert 3): the conclusion is based on the premise that globalization is solely responsible for job losses, ignoring the possibility of other factors contributing to this issue.
answer: circular reasoning

the final answer: answer: circular reasoning",False
243,Social media is messing with our heads. All these likes and follows are making us anxious and depressed. It's the price we pay for being so connected.,causal oversimplification,"step 1: appeal to emotion (appeal to negative emotion)
step 2: nothing (so far, no conclusion has been made about the argument itself)
step 3: nothing (still waiting for other experts to contribute)
step 4: correlation does not imply causation (the increase in social media use and anxiety/depression does not automatically mean that one is causing the other)
step 5: slippery slope fallacy (claiming that being connected through social media leads inevitably to anxiety and depression, without providing evidence for this claim)
step 6: nothing (still waiting for other experts to contribute)
answer: slippery slope fallacy",False
244,Distracted driving is the scourge of our roads. People can't put down their phones for a second and it's causing accidents left and right. Ban those devices I say.,causal oversimplification,answer: appeal to emotion,False
245,You see what happens when we lose our faith? Moral decay sets in. We need to get back to our roots and restore some order.,causal oversimplification,answer: appeal to fear,False
246,Fast food is the devil's work. Kids these days are hooked on burgers and fries and that's why we're seeing so many chubby youngsters.,causal oversimplification,"the first expert might write: 'appeal to fear: the statement creates a fear of fast food, linking it with obesity in children.'

the second expert might write: 'guilt by association: the statement implies that fast food is associated with negative outcomes, such as obesity.'

the third expert might write: 'nothing': 'there is no obvious fallacy present in the statement. it may be an exaggeration or a personal opinion, but it does not rely on any logical fallacies.'

all experts would then confer and agree that there is no obvious fallacy in the statement, although it may be an exaggeration or an expression of personal opinion. therefore, the answer: 'answer: nothing'.",False
247,Thank goodness for law enforcement cracking down. Crime rates are dropping because the cops are finally doing their job and putting criminals behind bars.,causal oversimplification,"answer: appeal to authority (fallacy of false authority)
1st expert: the statement implies that the police are responsible for the drop in crime rates, but no evidence is provided to support this claim about the actions of law enforcement.
2nd expert: moreover, we cannot assume that law enforcement is solely responsible for changes in crime rates; other factors may also play a role.
3rd expert: and even if law enforcement were proven to be effective in reducing crime, it would not necessarily mean that they are ""finally doing their job"" as implied by the statement. it could simply be an ongoing process of their normal duties.",False
248,All this sanitizing and cleaning is making us sick. Our immune systems are weak because we're not exposed to enough germs. Bring back the dirt I say.,causal oversimplification,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: this statement infers that something is true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole, which is a fallacy of division. the whole (all this sanitizing and cleaning) is not directly related to the size of every part of the situation (our immune systems).

expert 2: the claim assumes that by not being exposed to germs, our immune systems become weaker, which may not be true in all cases.

expert 3: the argument ignores other factors that could contribute to a weakened immune system, such as diet and overall health habits, making it a fallacy of oversimplification or ignoring relevant factors.

expert 1: i agree with expert 2 and expert 3 that the argument overlooks various contributing factors to a weakened immune system, but i also think the statement is using fallacious reasoning by implying a cause-and-effect relationship without providing evidence, which aligns with my understanding of the fallacy of causality.

expert 2 and expert 3: we agree that while the argument does not provide enough evidence to support its claim, it is primarily a fallacy of division since it infers something true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole (sanitizing and cleaning). the cause-and-effect relationship suggested by expert 1 is not the primary issue here.

answer: fallacy of division",False
249,Nobody reads anymore. Why bother when you can binge-watch the latest shows? It's no wonder literacy rates are plummeting.,causal oversimplification,"answer: appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion)

explanation (expert 1): the argument is using a positive emotion (the joy of watching tv shows) to make the conclusion seem reasonable, rather than providing substantial evidence in favor of the action.

explanation (expert 2): the statement is trying to manipulate our emotions to a positive direction to make the argument seemingly plausible without giving solid reasoning or facts.

explanation (expert 3): the arguer is attempting to sway us by appealing to positive emotions, rather than presenting evidence that reading has become less popular due to tv shows and not other factors.",False
250,Media bias is out of control. You can't trust anything you read or watch these days. It's no wonder we're all at each other's throats.,causal oversimplification,answer: appeal to anger,False
251,Climate change is to blame for everything including wildfires. It's getting hotter and drier out there and it's a recipe for disaster.,causal oversimplification,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the claim that climate change causes wildfires is being used as evidence for itself, creating a loop in reasoning.

expert 2: climate change being the cause of increasing heat and dryness is assumed to directly cause wildfires without any external evidence or facts provided.

expert 3: the argument assumes that since climate change causes conditions that are favorable for wildfires, therefore all wildfires must be caused by climate change, which ignores other potential factors like human activity and natural cycles.",False
252,The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. That's why depression rates are through the roof. It's inequality plain and simple.,causal oversimplification,"initial thoughts: the statement seems to be making a connection between wealth disparity (rich getting richer, poor getting poorer) and mental health (depression rates). however, it does not provide evidence or reasoning to support this claim, instead relying on emotional appeal to make the argument seem reasonable.

first expert: this statement appears to use an emotional appeal as a primary motivator for its conclusion, without any supporting evidence or reasoning provided.

second expert: it also seems to be making a causal connection between wealth disparity and mental health issues, but does not provide any data or statistics to support this claim.

third expert: the argument does not seem to have any logical structure, instead relying on vague emotional appeals to make its conclusion seem reasonable.

final answer: appeal to emotion",False
253,Terrorism is a direct result of extremist ideologies. They brainwash vulnerable individuals and that's why we're seeing more attacks.,causal oversimplification,"step 1: appeal to authority (false authority)
reasoning: the claim that terrorism is directly caused by extremist ideologies is presented as factual, but the argument lacks a clear, credible authority on the subject of terrorism who has made this assertion.

step 2: circular reasoning
reasoning: the premise suggests that terrorists are influenced and brainwashed by extremist ideologies, which implies that all terrorists hold these ideologies. however, this conclusion is used as evidence for the initial claim about terrorism being a result of extremist ideologies.

step 3: equivocation
reasoning: the argument does not clarify whether ""extremist"" refers to political or religious ideology, and without specifying which type of ideology, it becomes difficult to evaluate the truthfulness of the claim.

answer: circular reasoning (although equivocation is also present in the argument)",False
254,Families are falling apart because we've abandoned traditional values. Once upon a time marriage meant something but now it's just a joke.,causal oversimplification,"step 1: appeal to tradition
step 2: circular reasoning
step 3: nothing (since the previous two steps already indicate that the argument is fallacious)

answer: circular reasoning",False
255,COVID-19 vaccines are the cause of new variants emerging. If we stop vaccinating we'll stop new strains from developing.,causal oversimplification,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to fear - the statement uses the fear of new covid-19 variants as a primary motivator for people to accept that stopping vaccination will prevent new strains, despite the lack of justification or evidence for this claim.

step 2 (expert 2): fallacy of division - the argument assumes that because vaccines cause changes in the virus (variants), it means that stopping vaccination will prevent the development of new variants. this is a fallacious leap from the fact that vaccines can cause changes to the conclusion that stopping vaccination will stop the emergence of new strains.

step 3 (expert 3): final answer: fallacy of division",False
256,The rise in COVID-19 cases is solely due to people not wearing masks. If everyone just wore masks all the time the pandemic would be over.,causal oversimplification,"step 1 (expert a): this statement seems to be an example of an appeal to fear, as it suggests that not wearing masks will cause the pandemic to continue, creating a sense of urgency without providing evidence for this claim.

step 2 (expert b): however, the statement also implies a causation between mask-wearing and covid-19 cases, which is more appropriately classified as the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this). this fallacy assumes that just because one event follows another, it was caused by that event.

step 3 (expert c): further, the statement suggests that if everyone wore masks all the time the pandemic would be over, which is a form of circular reasoning. the conclusion (the pandemic would be over) relies on the premise (everyone wears masks), and vice versa.

answer: circular reasoning",False
257,The increase in global temperatures is solely caused by human activity particularly the use of fossil fuels. If we just switch to renewable energy sources we can solve the problem entirely.,causal oversimplification,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the argument relies on the assumption that human activity is the sole cause of global warming, which is what it seeks to prove.

expert 2: the claim that we can ""solve the problem entirely"" by switching to renewable energy sources implies that global warming is solely caused by human activity and fossil fuel use.

expert 3: since the conclusion depends on its premise, which in turn supports the conclusion, the reasoning forms a circle with no new information being shared.",False
258,Global warming is primarily caused by deforestation. If we stop cutting down trees we can reverse climate change and restore balance to the planet.,causal oversimplification,"step 1 (expert a): this statement seems to be making a cause and effect claim, but it lacks sufficient evidence to support the claim that global warming is primarily caused by deforestation.
step 2 (expert b): the argument also suggests that stopping deforestation can reverse climate change, which is a strong claim that requires extensive scientific evidence.
step 3 (expert c): however, it does not explain how or why the cessation of deforestation would have such an immediate and significant impact on global warming.
step 4 (expert a): moreover, there are other factors contributing to global warming that are not being considered in this argument.
step 5 (expert b): for example, industrial processes, fossil fuel emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture also contribute to global warming.
step 6 (expert c): therefore, the solution cannot be as simple as stopping deforestation.
answer: oversimplification or false cause fallacy",False
259,Extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts are directly caused by global warming. If we reduce carbon emissions we can prevent these disasters from occurring.,causal oversimplification,"initial classifications:
1. appeal to fear: the idea that extreme weather events will be prevented if carbon emissions are reduced is a premise without justification, as it could still happen even with reduced emissions.
2. slippery slope fallacy: the argument implies that if we don't reduce carbon emissions, all disasters will occur, which may not be true.
3. appeal to positive emotion: the appeal here is that we can prevent these negative events and make the world a better place by reducing carbon emissions, which can motivate people to act.

final answer: slippery slope fallacy",False
260,The decline in biodiversity is solely due to global warming. If we address climate change we can protect species from extinction and restore ecological balance.,causal oversimplification,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be making a cause-effect claim about the relationship between global warming and biodiversity decline.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it doesn't appear that any other factors contributing to biodiversity loss are being considered.

step 3 (expert 1): that's correct. the argument seems to be ignoring the potential impact of habitat destruction, pollution, overexploitation, and invasive species on biodiversity.

step 4 (expert 2): furthermore, the statement suggests that addressing climate change will automatically lead to the protection of species from extinction and restoration of ecological balance.

step 5 (expert 1): exactly, it appears to be a oversimplification of a complex issue by making a broad generalization about the impact of global warming on biodiversity and the solutions for its preservation.

final answer: oversimplification / fallacy of oversimplification",False
261,This is the correct answer because it is right.,circular reasoning,"the statement ""the us government should increase its spending on defense because terrorism is a real and present danger"" can be classified as an 'appeal to fear' fallacy.

here are the steps of reasoning for each expert:

expert 1: first, i observe that the argument uses the fear of terrorism as the primary motivator for the increase in defense spending. however, it does not provide any evidence or reason to back up this fear claim.

expert 2: secondly, i note that there is no indication that this fear of terrorism is justified or reasonable. the argument simply assumes that the fear exists without providing any substantiation for it.

expert 3: lastly, i realize that the argument relies solely on creating an emotionally charged response (fear) to persuade the audience rather than presenting facts and evidence to support its claim, making it an example of the 'appeal to fear' fallacy.

answer: appeal to fear",False
262,"You must obey the law, because it’s illegal to break the law.",circular reasoning,"answer: circular reasoning

step 1: the proposition is ""you must obey the law.""
step 2: the premise supporting this proposition is ""it's illegal to break the law.""
step 3: in order for the premise to be valid, it relies on the initial proposition, thus creating a circular argument where the conclusion is based on the very thing that is being proven.",True
263,"Harold’s new book is well written, because Harold is a wonderful writer.",circular reasoning,"step 1: appeal to authority (false authority)
step 2: circular reasoning
step 3: nothing (the argument does not necessarily contain any fallacy after combining the two previous steps)

answer: nothing",True
264,"America is the best place to live, because it’s better than any other country.",circular reasoning,"step 1 (expert a): the argument appeals to a positive emotion by trying to make the argument apparently seem reasonable based on the emotion of happiness or satisfaction.

step 2 (expert b): however, the argument also makes an implied comparison between america and all other countries, which may not be accurate or fair due to differences in geography, culture, resources, etc.

step 3 (expert c): furthermore, the argument does not provide any evidence or reasons for why america is better than all other countries, making it a subjective claim without objective support.

step 4 (all experts agree): answer: appeal to positive emotion and hasty generalization.",False
265,"Violent video games cause teens to be violent, because violent teens play violent video games.",circular reasoning,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: violent video games are being mentioned in the conclusion as well as the premise.
expert 2: the claim that violent video games cause teens to be violent is used as evidence for why violent teens play violent video games.
expert 3: therefore, the argument creates a circular reasoning where the conclusion is used to prove its own premise.",True
266,You need experience to get this job because only experienced people can do this job.,circular reasoning,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to tradition, as the assumption is that having experience in a role means one has learned from past experiences and thus can be more effective in said role.
step 2 (expert 2): however, it could also be argued that this statement ignores the possibility of newcomers who may bring fresh perspectives or innovative ideas to the job, thereby making them equally capable.
step 3 (expert 1): yes, that is a valid point; however, we must also consider if there are certain skills that can only be acquired through experience in the job itself.
step 4 (expert 2): that is true, but the statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning to suggest that this is always the case.
step 5 (expert 1): agreed; without supporting evidence or reasoning, we cannot definitively classify this statement as anything other than an argument based on tradition, which can be misleading and potentially fallacious.
answer: appeal to tradition",False
267,I am always right because I never make mistakes.,circular reasoning,"step 1: circular reasoning
explanation: the claim relies on its own premise (i.e., not making mistakes means always being right) to support its conclusion that the speaker is always right, creating a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared.

step 2: nothing (since everyone agrees with step 1)
explanation: since all experts agree that the statement shows circular reasoning, there is no need for further steps or discussion as they have reached a final agreement on the fallacy classification.

answer: circular reasoning",True
268,Our party's policies are the best because we are the best party,circular reasoning,"step 1: appeal to authority (the experts in this case are claiming that their party is the best based on their own authority as members of the party)
step 2: appeal to tradition (the implication here is that the party has been around for a long time, and therefore its policies must be good because they have stood the test of time)
step 3: circular reasoning (the argument essentially states that the best party has the best policies, and the party with the best policies is the best party - this creates a circular logic where the conclusion is supported by the premise, which is supported by the conclusion)

final answer: appeal to authority, appeal to tradition, circular reasoning.",True
269,The accused is untrustworthy because they have been accused of crime.,circular reasoning,answer: guilt by association,False
270,It should be okay to destroy property when you are angry because angry people destroy things.,circular reasoning,answer: appeal to anger,False
271,You have to save enough money to pay your bills each month because bills have to be paid.,circular reasoning,"initial thought (expert 1): this statement is an argument by consequences, where the conclusion is based on the belief that certain actions will lead to specific outcomes. however, it does not explicitly appeal to fear or other emotions.

initial thought (expert 2): the reasoning seems straightforward and rational; there is no obvious fallacy being committed here.

initial thought (expert 3): there doesn't appear to be a premise based on false authority or an argument that relies on a straw man, guilt by association, or circular reasoning. also, the appeal to tradition does not seem applicable in this case.

additional thought (all experts): the statement is neither equivocating nor committing the fallacy of division. furthermore, it does not make use of tu quoque, appeal to positive emotions, or appeal to pity.

conclusion (all experts): answer: nothing",True
272,He is a great leader because he leads well.,circular reasoning,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of circular reasoning, as the conclusion is based on the premise that the person leads well, and the definition of a great leader is someone who leads well.

step 2 (expert 2): however, there seems to be no additional evidence or justification provided for why this person leads well.

step 3 (expert 3): without any further information on the qualities or actions that make this individual lead well, it would be difficult to classify this statement as anything other than 'nothing.' it does not seem to contain an obvious fallacy.",True
273,Eating healthy foods is good because healthy foods are beneficial for you.,circular reasoning,answer: appeal to positive emotion,False
274,"She is trustworthy because she always tells the truth, and we know she always tells the truth because she is trustworthy.",circular reasoning,"answer: circular reasoning
explanation (expert 1): the claim that someone is trustworthy because they always tell the truth relies on its own premise (i.e., the person always tells the truth) to support its conclusion that the person is trustworthy, creating a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared.
explanation (expert 2): the argument provides no evidence or reason as to why the person always tells the truth other than stating that they are trustworthy, making it circular in nature.
explanation (expert 3): the claim does not establish any external validation for why we should believe this person is trustworthy; instead, it presents an internal loop between trustworthiness and telling the truth without providing additional evidence or reason.",True
275,"We know that God exists because the Bible says so, and we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God.",circular reasoning,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the argument assumes that the bible is the word of god in order to prove the truth of the bible. (circular reasoning)
expert 2: since the bible's truth is being used as evidence for its own claims, it creates a self-reinforcing loop with no external verification. (circular reasoning)",True
276,This restaurant is the best in town because it’s better than the others.,circular reasoning,"initial thoughts: the statement might be an example of ""appeal to majority"" fallacy, as it's arguing that something is good because it's superior to other options available (in this case, restaurants). however, the term ""best"" suggests a degree of objectivity, and there could potentially be other factors not considered in the argument.

second thoughts: the statement does not use any emotional manipulation or fear, so we can rule out ""appeal to anger"", ""appeal to fear"", and ""appeal to positive emotion"". also, it doesn't rely on tradition, so ""appeal to tradition"" is not applicable here. the statement doesn't mischaracterize an argument or use equivocation, so we can rule out ""straw man fallacy"" and ""equivocation"".

third thoughts: the argument does not compare the restaurant with the worst case scenario (e.g., other restaurants), so it's not an example of ""appeal to worse problems"". there is no circular reasoning in this statement, as the conclusion does not rely on the premise for its validity. the statement also doesn't guilt by association, so we can rule out that fallacy as well.

fourth thoughts: the argument is based on a comparison between the restaurant and others (of the same category), which might suggest that it could be an example of ""comparison fallacy"" if the basis for comparison is flawed or inappropriate. however, the statement doesn't claim any absolute superiority; it just states that the restaurant is ""better.""

final thoughts: the statement can be classified as a weak form of ""appeal to majority,"" but it does not strictly fit the definition due to the lack of an emphasis on consensus or universality. instead, we can classify this statement as an example of ""simplistic comparison"" or ""oversimplification,"" where the argument oversimplifies the complexity of determining what constitutes the ""best"" restaurant in town by focusing only on comparative superiority without considering other important factors.

answer: simplistic comparison / oversimplification",True
277,"Her advice is always good because it is helpful, and it is helpful because her advice is always good.",circular reasoning,answer: circular reasoning,True
278,The plan is foolproof because it can’t fail.,circular reasoning,"answer: appeal to authority (false)

explanation: the claim relies on the idea that a plan is foolproof, which requires justification or evidence. the fact that it's called a ""foolproof"" plan does not mean it cannot fail without evidence supporting this claim.",False
279,He is the most talented musician because his music is the best.,circular reasoning,"step 1: appeal to authority (false authority)
step 2: nothing, all experts agree on this step
step 3: hypothetically, if one expert argues that this could also be circular reasoning because ""best"" is being determined by the authority of the musician's talent, but the other two experts disagree, stating that an authority's opinion in a field (music) can be relevant and not fall under circular reasoning.
step 4: the remaining two experts agree that this argument does not fit any other fallacies described above, as it is merely stating a claim without providing any additional context or justification beyond the authority's opinion.
answer: nothing",True
280,This novel is a masterpiece because it is an excellent book.,circular reasoning,"step 1: appeal to positive emotion (the use of the word ""masterpiece"" implies that reading the book will evoke a positive response, rather than providing substantial evidence in favor of the claim)
step 2: no further steps are necessary as all experts agree on the classification
answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
281,The workout program is the best because it produces the best results.,circular reasoning,"step 1: appeal to positive emotion
step 2: none of the experts have reached a conclusion that this is not an argument or fallacy, so they continue.
step 3: the statement does not present any evidence or reasoning for its claim about the workout program being the best, but it is trying to influence people's emotions to think positively about the program. therefore, the experts agree that this is an example of an appeal to positive emotion fallacy.
answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
282,The judge is just and fair because he sets the innocent free and punishes the guilty.,circular reasoning,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the claim that the judge is just and fair because he sets the innocent free and punishes the guilty assumes that what the judge does (setting the innocent free and punishing the guilty) is a definition of justice and fairness, which it is not. this creates a circular argument.

expert 2: however, if we consider justice as an ideal to strive for that includes setting the innocent free and punishing the guilty, then the statement could be rephrased to suggest that the judge upholds justice by setting the innocent free and punishing the guilty. but this would still be circular reasoning because it implies that the judge's actions are the definition of justice, which is not necessarily true.

expert 3: it seems that the initial statement assumes a connection between the actions of the judge (setting the innocent free and punishing the guilty) and justice itself, but this assumption is unproven. in order to avoid circular reasoning, we would need to provide evidence or argument that links these actions with justice.

answer: circular reasoning",True
283,"People who fail out of school do so because they are not smart, and they are not smart because they fail out of school.",circular reasoning,answer: circular reasoning,True
284,It’s important to argue logically because logic is an essential part of argumentation.,circular reasoning,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be making an assumption, but it's not clear what exact fallacy it represents. let's break it down further.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement implies that there are only two options: either logic is essential or it's not. however, it doesn't consider the possibility that logic might be important to some extent but not necessarily essential in all contexts. this seems like a form of false dichotomy.

step 3 (expert 3): if we accept that the statement presents a false dichotomy, then it is attempting to make an argument based on extreme assumptions rather than acknowledging the complexity of the situation. this can be classified as an appeal to extremes.

final answer: appeal to extremes",False
285,Fake news is harmful because it’s bad if the news isn’t real!,circular reasoning,answer: appeal to emotion,False
286,You should always do what you are being told because following the rules is important.,circular reasoning,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of the ""appeal to authority"" fallacy, as it suggests that one should always follow the rules because someone or some group has said so, without providing evidence that these authorities have the relevant expertise or knowledge on this specific issue.

step 2 (expert 2): however, upon closer inspection, the statement could also be interpreted as an example of ""appeal to tradition,"" since following the rules is often seen as important due to historical precedents and social norms.

step 3 (expert 3): while there may be elements of both fallacies present, the primary focus of the statement seems to be on emphasizing the importance of adhering to rules without question, which aligns more closely with an ""appeal to authority"" argument based on tradition.

answer: appeal to authority (based on tradition)",False
287,Personal happiness is the meaning of life because nothing is as important as being happy!,circular reasoning,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)

explanation: the person here is trying to make the argument apparently seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the claim that personal happiness is the meaning of life.",False
288,Using evidence is important because it is important to use evidence.,circular reasoning,"'answer: circular reasoning'
explanation: the statement uses the very thing (evidence) that it is trying to support as its argument, creating a circular reasoning fallacy.",True
289,"You can't get credit unless you have a good credit rating, and you can't have a good credit rating unless you have gotten a credit. ",circular reasoning,"answer: circular reasoning. explanation: the argument is that one cannot have a good credit rating without getting credit first, but one also cannot get credit without having a good credit rating. this creates a circular argument where each premise relies on the other to support its validity, with no new information being added to strengthen the overall argument.",True
290,"You say smoking is harmful, but you smoke!",tu quoque,"step 1 (expert a): tu quoque fallacy - the arguer points out that the person making the claim does not follow it themselves, which distracts from the truth of the claim.

step 2 (expert b): appeal to hypocrisy is a type of tu quoque fallacy but emphasizes the inconsistency between words and actions more explicitly. here we have an instance of appeal to hypocrisy.

step 3 (expert c): the arguer does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support their claim, they simply point out a perceived inconsistency in the behavior of the person making the claim. this is an example of argument from personal character (or ad hominem) fallacy, as it attacks the person rather than addressing their argument directly.

final answer: appeal to hypocrisy (ad hominem fallacy)",True
291,You think Canada's healthcare system is better than the US but you are staying in the US.,tu quoque,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement shows a contradiction between what the person thinks and their actions, which is an example of tu quoque fallacy.

step 2 (expert 2): however, the argument does not seem to be based on emotion or fear, so it's not an appeal to anger or an appeal to fear fallacy.

step 3 (expert 3): additionally, the statement does not seem to rely on tradition, false authority, straw man, circular reasoning, guilt by association, equivocation, fallacy of division, or appeal to positive emotion for its argument.

final answer: tu quoque",True
292,Why should I clean my room given that you don't clean yours?,tu quoque,"answer: tu quoque

step 1: the argument suggests that because the speaker's sibling (or whoever else is being compared) does not clean their room, it is not necessary for the speaker to clean their own room.

step 2: this argument falls under the fallacy of 'tu quoque', as it is an attempt to dismiss the validity of the argument by pointing out that the person making the argument (the sibling in this case) does not follow the claim they are making (cleaning their room). however, whether or not someone else cleans their room is irrelevant to whether or not the speaker should clean their own room.",True
293,You don't actually believe hamburger is harmful because you eat hamburgers.,tu quoque,"step 1 (expert a): tu quoque - the argument infers that because the speaker contradicts their own claims, their argument is invalid. however, inconsistency in actions does not necessarily imply an invalid argument.

step 2 (expert b): appeal to anger - the emotion of anger is used as a substitute for evidence in the argument. the fact that the arguer is offended or angry is irrelevant to the facts.

step 3 (expert c): nothing - there does not seem to be any obvious fallacy being committed in this statement. it appears to be more of an observation about human behavior rather than an attempt to persuade through a logical argument.",True
294,You can't actually believe to the global warming because you drive SUV.,tu quoque,"step 1: appeal to false authority (shongmiester, while an adult film star, is not an expert on climate science)
step 2: fallacy of division (the argument infers that driving an suv means one denies the existence of global warming, but not everyone who drives an suv holds this belief)
final answer: appeal to false authority and fallacy of division",False
295,"You say we should be kind to others, but you yelled at a cashier.",tu quoque,"step 1 (expert 1): tu quoque fallacy - the arguer is criticizing the act of being kind because the person making the argument does not always practice what they preach.

step 2 (expert 2): nothing - even though the arguer has a history of inconsistency, this alone does not necessarily invalidate the advice to be kind to others.

step 3 (expert 3): appeal to anger fallacy - the arguer's emotion (anger) is being used as evidence against the argument for kindness, rather than providing actual reasoning or evidence.

answer: appeal to anger",True
296,"She says lying is wrong, but she lied about her age once.",tu quoque,"answer: tu quoque

step 1 (first expert): the person is claiming that the argument is flawed by pointing out that the one making the argument does not act consistently with the claims of the argument.

step 2 (second expert): the point of inconsistency does not matter to the truth claim of the argument at least, as it might be an isolated incident rather than a pattern of behavior.

step 3 (third expert): however, the person is still using the inconsistent behavior as evidence against the argument, which fits the definition of tu quoque fallacy.",True
297,"He says we should recycle, but I saw him throw a can in the trash.",tu quoque,answer: tu quoque (i pointed out that he does not act consistently with his claims),True
298,"You argue that we should eat less meat for the environment, but you had a steak last night.",tu quoque,"initial thoughts: this statement seems to be an example of tu quoque fallacy, as the argument is criticized by pointing out that the person making the argument does not follow their own advice (eating less meat).

second thoughts: however, if we consider the possibility that the person who made the argument might have had a special occasion or extenuating circumstances for eating the steak, it could be argued that there's insufficient evidence to determine whether this is indeed an example of tu quoque fallacy.

third thoughts: considering further discussion and group input, if we assume that the person making the argument had no special occasion or extenuating circumstances for eating the steak, it appears they might be hypocritically not following their own advice while urging others to do so. this could still be classified as tu quoque fallacy, but with some caveats on the conditions under which the steak was consumed.

final answer: answer: tu quoque (with the assumption that there were no special circumstances for consuming the steak)",True
299,"They advocate for exercise, but they haven’t been to the gym in weeks.",tu quoque,"step 1 (all experts): recognize that the statement mentions an action advocated for by the speaker and the speaker's own behavior, which may seem contradictory.

step 2 (experts a & b): observe that this is an example of tu quoque fallacy, as the argument's validity is challenged by pointing out the speaker's inconsistency.

step 3 (expert c): recognize that it does not necessarily mean that the statement is true or false based on the speaker's actions. the argument can still be valid or invalid regardless of the speaker's behavior, so we cannot classify it as a tu quoque fallacy.

step 4 (all experts): determine that the contradiction between advocating for exercise and not going to the gym is not relevant to the truth claim of the argument itself, so there are no logical fallacies present in this statement.

answer: nothing",True
300,"You tell me to save money, but you just bought a new car.",tu quoque,"step 1: tu quoque (appeal to hypocrisy) - the argument is that because the person giving advice about saving money is not following their own advice by buying a new car, the advice given is invalid.

step 2: appeal to positive emotion (appeal to emotion) - by using the emotional response of hypocrisy to make the argument appear weak or illogical.

step 3: nothing - no further steps are necessary as both experts have agreed on 'tu quoque' and 'appeal to positive emotion.'

answer: tu quoque (appeal to hypocrisy)",True
301,"You claim we should support local businesses, but you shop online all the time.",tu quoque,"answer: tu quoque (appeal to hypocrisy)

first expert: the argument is that because someone is doing something contradictory to what they are advocating for, their argument must be invalid.
second expert: the arguer's actions do not affect the validity of their claims, as one can hold a belief and still struggle to adhere to it in practice.
third expert: however, bringing up the arguer's hypocrisy is still irrelevant to the argument itself and should not be used to question its validity.",True
302,"He believes in eating healthy, but I saw him eat a donut yesterday.",tu quoque,"step 1 (first expert): tu quoque fallacy - the argument is criticized based on the observed inconsistency between what the person claims and what they do themselves.
step 2 (second expert): nothing - there's no appeal to fear, false authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, anger, straw man, tradition, equivocation, division, or positive emotion being made in this argument.
step 3 (third expert): nothing - no further steps needed as there is a consensus that the argument falls under tu quoque fallacy.
answer: tu quoque fallacy",True
303,"My sister argues for reducing screen time, but she is always on her phone.",tu quoque,"step 1: tu quoque (the argument is flawed by pointing out that the one making the argument is not acting consistently with the claims of the argument)
step 2: appeal to negative emotion (the emotions of anger and frustration are substituted for evidence in the argument)
answer: tu quoque & appeal to negative emotion",True
304,"My friends insist on the importance of education, but they dropped out of college.",tu quoque,"step 1: appeal to hypocrisy (tu quoque) - the friends are criticizing others for not valuing education while they themselves have dropped out.
step 2: hypocritical criticism is not a recognized fallacy on its own, but it can be considered as a form of undermining the argument by pointing out inconsistency within the arguer's statements and actions - appeal to hypocrisy used to support another fallacy (e.g., argumentum ad hominem)
step 3: the argument about education's importance is not being directly refuted or undermined, so no specific fallacy of reasoning can be identified - 'answer: nothing'.",True
305,"The neighbors advocate for voting, but they didn't vote in the last election.",tu quoque,"step 1 (expert 1): tu quoque fallacy - the argument is that the neighbors are advocating for voting but did not do so themselves in the last election, which undermines their credibility as advocates.

step 2 (expert 2): nothing - the argument does not commit any other identified fallacies in the given explanation.

step 3 (expert 3): nothing - there are no other apparent fallacies in the given explanation.

answer: tu quoque",True
306,"The politican promotes reducing carbon footprints, but he flew to his vacation destination.",tu quoque,"step 1 (expert a): this is an example of the ""tu quoque"" fallacy, as the politician is being criticized for not following the very advice they are promoting.

step 2 (expert b): however, it's important to note that in this case, the politician's inconsistency between their words and actions does not necessarily invalidate the truth or necessity of reducing carbon footprints.

step 3 (expert c): therefore, the statement does not represent a clear fallacy; the politician's hypocrisy is relevant but insufficient to discredit the claim about carbon footprint reduction.

answer: nothing",True
307,"The celebrity argues for animal rights, but she wears leather shoes.",tu quoque,"the first expert might write: 'appeal to hypocrisy' (the celebrity is criticizing others while not following the same principles herself).

the second expert might write: 'nothing' (since the argument about the celebrity's actions does not directly relate to her advocacy for animal rights).

the third expert might write: 'nothing' (as it is not a fallacy to engage in behavior that contradicts one's beliefs, as long as the argument remains logically sound).

the fourth expert might write: 'answer: nothing'.",False
308,"You say we should read more books, but you watch TV every night.",tu quoque,"answer: tu quoque

1st expert: the argument is based on the fact that the speaker doesn't follow their own advice, rather than addressing the truth or validity of the advice itself.
2nd expert: the argument attempts to criticize the advice by pointing out a hypocrisy in the speaker's actions, not addressing the value of reading books.
3rd expert: by emphasizing the speaker's inconsistency, the argument attempts to discredit their advice without considering its merit on its own.
4th expert: the argument focuses on the speaker instead of the topic at hand, and does not address the benefits or importance of reading books.
5th expert: as the speakers actions are irrelevant to the validity of the advice, the argument is a fallacy known as tu quoque.",True
309,My classmates believe in climate change while using plastic bags at the same time.,tu quoque,"step 1 (expert 1): this seems like an example of cognitive dissonance, where people hold two contradictory beliefs or values simultaneously. however, it's not a fallacy per se; rather, it's a psychological phenomenon.

step 2 (expert 2): cognitive dissonance can be used to explain the behavior, but it doesn't necessarily imply that an argument is being made or fallacious reasoning is occurring. so, let's look for any potential fallacies within this statement.

step 3 (expert 3): upon closer examination, it appears that there isn't a clear appeal to fear, authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, anger, straw man, tradition, equivocation, division, tu quoque, positive emotion, or pity fallacies in this statement. it primarily describes an observation about the behavior of the classmates and doesn't make any arguments or conclusions that can be classified as fallacies.

answer: nothing",True
310,"The boss said people should be punctual, but he was late to our last meeting.",tu quoque,"step 1: tu quoque (appeal to hypocrisy)

step 2: the boss's being late to a meeting does not discredit the importance of punctuality.

step 3: however, if the boss is emphasizing the value of punctuality while disregarding it himself, then he may appear as an unreliable or untrustworthy authority on the subject.

final answer: tu quoque (appeal to hypocrisy)",True
311,"The president argue for wearing masks, but he was seen without one.",tu quoque,"step 1 (expert 1): tu quoque fallacy - the argument is invalidated by pointing out that the speaker is not acting consistently with their claims.

step 2 (expert 2): the fact that the president was seen without a mask does not necessarily mean that wearing masks is not important or effective, as there could be many reasons for this discrepancy.

step 3 (expert 3): however, if it can be shown that the president's actions are inconsistent with his stated position for political gain, then it would be a fallacy of hypocrisy rather than tu quoque. in this case, more information is required to make a definitive classification.

step 4 (expert 1): if more evidence is provided showing the president's inconsistency is intentional and for political gain, then it would indeed be a fallacy of hypocrisy. but without that additional information, we cannot definitively classify it as such, so the answer remains 'answer: tu quoque'.",True
312,"My friend promotes a vegan lifestyle, but she occasionally eats cheese.",tu quoque,"step 1 (expert 1): this could be an example of hypocrisy, as the person is promoting something they don't fully follow themselves.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it's not hypocrisy if the person doesn't claim veganism to be a strict moral rule that must be followed at all times by everyone. they might see it as a preference or lifestyle choice with occasional exceptions.

step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, promoting a lifestyle and following it aren't necessarily linked. a person can influence others to adopt a particular lifestyle without personally adhering to every aspect of it.

step 4 (expert 1): in this case, the statement does not represent any fallacy. it simply demonstrates that people don't always live up to their own beliefs or promotion, but it doesn't invalidate the validity of the promoted lifestyle itself.

answer: nothing",False
313,"The roommate says alcohol is bad for me, but he has a drink every weekend.",tu quoque,"step 1 (expert 1): tu quoque fallacy - the roommate's argument is being discredited by pointing out their inconsistency in following their own advice.

step 2 (expert 2): appeal to anger fallacy - ignoring the fact that alcohol may or may not be bad for the roommate, the arguer is expressing their anger without providing evidence or reason.

step 3 (expert 3): nothing - the statement does not contain any clear fallacies in the given context; it simply highlights a hypocritical behavior from the roommate and emotional reaction from the speaker. however, the argument itself is neither logically sound nor fallacious.",True
314,"They insist on honesty, but they told a white lie to your friend.",tu quoque,answer: guilt by association,False
315,"You believe in gender equality, but you made a sexist joke.",tu quoque,"initial thoughts: this statement seems to be an example of the ""guilt by association"" fallacy because it is trying to claim that someone who believes in gender equality cannot also make a sexist joke, which implies that being sexist and believing in gender equality are mutually exclusive.

second thought: however, if we consider the possibility that the person making the statement might have made the sexist joke unknowingly or without realizing it was offensive, then it could be argued that this is not necessarily a case of guilt by association, but rather an example of a different fallacy such as ""appeal to anger"" or ""straw man fallacy"".

third thought: if we focus on the statement itself, it does seem like a straw man fallacy because it misrepresents the belief in gender equality as being exclusive with making sexist jokes. the arguer is assuming that someone who believes in gender equality must be perfect and never make offensive or insensitive comments, which is not true.

final answer: 'answer: straw man fallacy'.",False
316,"Her best friend promotes time management, but she procrastinates often.",tu quoque,"step 1: guilt by association (the friend is viewed negatively because of her association with poor time management)
step 2: tu quoque (the argument is flawed by pointing out that the one making the argument - the friend - is not acting consistently with the claims of the argument - promoting time management)
answer: tu quoque",True
317,"You say we should donate to charity, but you haven't donated in years.",tu quoque,"answer: tu quoque

1st expert: the arguer is claiming that the person making the argument doesn’t follow their own advice or claim, thus trying to invalidate the argument made by the original speaker.
2nd expert: the arguer is using the fact that the original speaker does not follow their own advice as a reason to disregard the argument itself, rather than addressing the evidence and reasoning provided by the original speaker.
3rd expert: the arguer is trying to disprove an argument made by another person by pointing out inconsistencies in the behavior of the person making the argument, even though this does not affect the truth of the argument itself.",True
318,"You argue that everyone should respect the elderly, but you ignore your grandparents.",tu quoque,"answer: tu quoque (appeal to hypocrisy)

expert 1: the argument states a claim that everyone should respect the elderly. however, the arguer in question does not practice what they preach by ignoring their own grandparents.

expert 2: the fact that the arguer does not practice their own advice is being used as a counterargument against their initial claim.

expert 3: this is an attempt to discredit the argument by pointing out the inconsistency between the person's words and actions, which is considered tu quoque or appeal to hypocrisy.",True
319,Sure philosophy helps you argue better but do we really need to encourage people to argue? There's enough hostility in this world.,equivocation,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to pity)

expert 1: the statement presents an argument that starts with a positive aspect about philosophy (helping one argue better) and then introduces an opposite opinion (encouraging people to argue). this creates a conflict of emotions between the positive and negative aspects.

expert 2: the author concludes by expressing concern about ""enough hostility in this world,"" attempting to manipulate our emotions by appealing to the position of pity, making us feel empathetic towards the idea that there is too much hostility already.

expert 3: the argument does not provide any substantial evidence or reason for its conclusion (encouraging people to argue) but instead relies on our emotions, specifically appeal to pity in this case, as a primary motivator to accept the statement.",False
320,I don't see how you can say you're an ethical person. It's so hard to get you to do anything; your work ethic is so bad,equivocation,"step 1: tu quoque (appeal to hypocrisy) - the argument attacks the character of the person being argued with, rather than addressing the actual ethical question at hand.
step 2: guilt by association - the argument assumes that because someone lacks a strong work ethic in one area, they are therefore unethical as a whole.
step 3: fallacy of division - the argument infers that something is true of one aspect (work ethic) from the fact that it is true of the whole (person's ethical standing).
answer: tu quoque (appeal to hypocrisy) with elements of guilt by association and fallacy of division.",False
321,Philosophy is supposed to stand on neutral ground. But most philosophers argue for very definite conclusions. This is hardly standing on neutral ground. Shouldn't we conclude that most philosophers aren't doing philosophy?,equivocation,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the conclusion (most philosophers aren’t doing philosophy) is based on the premise (philosophers argue for definite conclusions), which itself relies on the same conclusion.

expert 2: the argument assumes that arguing for definite conclusions contradicts standing on neutral ground, but this is not necessarily true. philosophy can involve arguing for specific conclusions while still maintaining an objective stance.

expert 1: however, in this context, if philosophers are arguing for definite conclusions, they are making value judgments and taking a position rather than remaining neutral. this is contradictory to the definition of philosophy being on neutral ground.

expert 2: i agree that philosophers advocating for specific conclusions might be seen as not standing completely on neutral ground. however, it's important to note that there can still be room for disagreement and multiple interpretations within the field, so it may not always be accurate to say that most philosophers aren’t doing philosophy.

expert 1: in this case, it appears that we are saying the absence of neutrality in philosophy means that most philosophers aren't doing philosophy, which is a circular argument because our premise relies on the conclusion.

expert 2: i see your point, and since we have reached an impasse where our reasoning seems to be leading us back to the same argument, it appears that our final answer is 'answer: circular reasoning'.",False
322,A warm beer is better than a cold beer. nothing is better than a cold beer and a warm beer is better than nothing.,equivocation,answer: fallacy of division,False
323,A self-defense class teaches participants how to fight better but fighting is wrong. So we shouldn’t have a self-defense class on campus.,equivocation,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the argument that fighting is wrong is used as evidence against having a self-defense class. this means the premise and conclusion share common ground, leading to circular reasoning.

expert 2: the statement implies that learning how to fight better could lead participants to engage in more fights. however, this assumption does not take into account the purpose of a self-defense class: to learn to defend oneself against violence rather than instigate it.

expert 3: if learning how to fight better results in an increase in fights, then it is assumed that all self-defense classes are responsible for promoting violence on campus. this oversimplification and assumption about the effects of a self-defense class constitute a fallacy.

the experts reach a consensus that the statement presents a case of circular reasoning because the argument uses the very concept it seeks to prove as evidence, i.e., that fighting is wrong, in order to support its conclusion that we shouldn’t have a self-defense class on campus.",False
324,Raspberries are fruits so raspberry sherbet counts as a serving of fruit.,equivocation,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

1st expert: the term ""fruit"" is being used ambiguously, referring both to the fresh form of the raspberry and its processed counterpart (raspberry sherbet).

2nd expert: however, the quality of being a fruit in its natural state does not automatically imply that its processed derivatives maintain the same qualities.

3rd expert: therefore, it is incorrect to assume that raspberry sherbet qualifies as a serving of fruit under this reasoning, given the ambiguous nature of the term ""fruit"".",True
325,Our company prides itself on efficiency so we’ve decided to reduce costs this year.,equivocation,"step 1: initial observation - the statement seems to suggest a cause (reducing costs) and an effect (the company's pride).

step 2: identifying potential fallacies - given the cause-effect relationship, one possible fallacy here could be 'causal oversimplification', as it might not be clear that reducing costs directly impacts the company's pride.

step 3: evaluating evidence and reasoning - however, since there is no explicit connection between cost reduction and increased pride, it appears that this statement is an example of an 'implied causation' fallacy, where a cause-effect relationship is suggested without proper evidence or justification.

answer: implied causation",False
326,I have the right to free speech so it’s right for me to say whatever I want.,equivocation,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of the appeal to authority fallacy because the argument is based on the assumption that having the right to free speech implies that anything said under its umbrella is automatically right.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it could also be argued that this statement is not necessarily a fallacy if the context in which free speech is being discussed is relevant to the argument at hand and the speaker's point is supported by additional evidence or reasoning.

step 3 (expert 3): in the given statement, there seems to be no supporting evidence or reasoning provided for the conclusion that anything said under the right to free speech is automatically right. therefore, i would classify it as an example of the appeal to authority fallacy.

answer: appeal to authority",False
327,I told my family that I’d miss the reunion because I’m coming home from vacation that week. I get home Thursday and the reunion is Friday,equivocation,"initial expert response: appeal to tradition (marriage has been traditional between a man and a woman, so the reunion's expectation may also follow this tradition).

second expert response: circular reasoning (the fact that the expert missed an event traditionally attended on certain days because they were returning from vacation is used as evidence for the tradition that friday reunions are expected, while the tradition itself was not questioned).

third expert response: fallacy of division (the individual missing the reunion doesn't mean all people coming home from vacation will miss it, and vice versa).

final answer: fallacy of division.",False
328,Everyone should fight for what they believe in. You disagree with my beliefs so I'm going to punch you in the nose.,equivocation,"answer: appeal to anger

step 1 (expert 1): the argument starts by stating that everyone should fight for what they believe in, which seems reasonable. however, the conclusion is not a logical outcome from this premise and instead is based on emotions.

step 2 (expert 2): the conclusion suggests physical violence as a solution to disagreement, which is unacceptable and goes against principles of peaceful conflict resolution.

step 3 (expert 3): the argument uses the emotions of anger as a substitute for evidence in the reasoning, thereby committing an appeal to anger fallacy.",False
329,"Without money, you can not even have christmas, think about it",equivocation,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to fear)
explanation: the statement is attempting to create a strong emotional response by implying that one cannot have christmas without money. however, this statement lacks evidence or reason to support the claim, making it a fallacy of reasoning based on emotions.",False
330,Smoking is necessary if you are addicted to it.,equivocation,"answer: circular reasoning

1st expert: the conclusion (smoking is necessary) depends on the premise (being addicted), but the premise also depends on the conclusion (one becomes addicted by smoking regularly).
2nd expert: this creates a loop where the conclusion supports the premise, which in turn supports the conclusion, making it circular reasoning.
3rd expert: no further steps necessary, as the second expert's observation confirms that this is an instance of circular reasoning.",False
331,"It is effective to censor parts of the media, because you never know who is watching.",equivocation,"the first expert would classify this statement as ""appeal to fear"". this is because the statement uses the fear of uncertainty (who might be watching) as a primary motivator to justify censorship, without providing evidence or reasoning for its necessity.

the second expert would build on the previous step by identifying that the use of fear in this context is not based on actual evidence or justification, making it an example of ""appeal to fear without evidence or reason"".

the third expert would agree with the classification and add a final step: this argument does not address any specific concerns related to censorship or provide any arguments that strengthen its case, but instead focuses solely on generating fear. therefore, the final answer is 'answer: appeal to fear without evidence or reason'.",False
332,Children should learn in classroom. Our land needs more well educated people.,equivocation,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be making an argument based on the assumed positive consequences of something (educating children) for another thing (improving the land). this could potentially be an example of 'appeal to consequences'.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it is not directly stating that learning in classrooms will lead to improving the land. it seems more like a suggestion or implication rather than a logical deduction. therefore, it may be better classified as 'argument from implications' instead.

step 3 (expert 3): upon further inspection, the argument appears to be using a general improvement in education level as a means to improve something else unrelated (land). this can also be considered an example of the 'appeal to consequences' fallacy, but with a subtle twist due to the indirectness.

since all experts have come to a final agreement, the answer is: 'answer: appeal to consequences'.",False
333,"Drinking at home is also harmful, but nobody argues against drinking.",equivocation,"step 1 (expert a): this seems to be an example of the fallacy known as 'appeal to silence' or 'argumentum ad silentium'. the argument infers that since no one argues against a certain claim, it must be true. however, the absence of evidence against a claim is not proof of its truth.

step 2 (expert b): i agree with expert a's classification of this statement as an 'appeal to silence'. the argument assumes that because there is no opposition to the idea that drinking at home can be harmful, it means the opposite – that drinking at home is not harmful – is incorrect.

step 3 (expert c): my observation aligns with what both experts have said. this statement presents an 'appeal to silence'. by assuming that the absence of opposition proves the claim's validity, the arguer commits a logical fallacy.

answer: appeal to silence",False
334,"Yes, they should. These drug-users are all dumb, look at their results in school.",equivocation,"answer: guilt by association

expert 1: these drug-users are being generalized as 'dumb' based on a negative stereotype that is not necessarily accurate. (stereotyping)

expert 2: the argument uses the group of drug-users to make a judgment about an individual, which isn't valid. (false cause)

expert 3: the conclusion that these individuals are 'dumb' solely because they are drug-users is not supported by any evidence or reasoning, thus it is a fallacy. (lack of evidence)

the experts agree on the classification as guilt by association.",False
335,Feathers are light. What is light cannot be dark.,equivocation,"step 1 (expert 1): dichotomy fallacy - the statement presents two extremes (light and dark) when the reality can have gradients or shades in between.

step 2 (expert 2): false dichotomy - although feathers can appear lighter than other objects, they can also be shaded or tinted to various degrees of darkness without losing their essential quality as 'light.'

step 3 (expert 3): nothing - since the initial statement does not include any emotional manipulation, false authority, fear-based reasoning, or association with undesirable entities, no other fallacies are applicable.

final answer: false dichotomy",False
336,Everyone is selfish because everyone always seeks pleasure.,equivocation,"step 1: circular reasoning (the argument relies on the premise that being selfish equates to seeking pleasure, which is then used as evidence for the claim that everyone seeks pleasure)
step 2: appeal to tradition (the argument implies that since everyone has been acting selfish up until now, it must be a natural state of humans)
step 3: generalization fallacy (the argument over-generalizes based on the assumption that all individuals share the same motivations and behaviors as observed in some)
answer: circular reasoning, appeal to tradition, generalization fallacy.",False
337,We must have faith in our leaders for without faith we have no hope. Faith has led humanity through its darkest hours.,equivocation,"this statement seems to be an example of 'appeal to emotion' fallacy, as the argument is trying to persuade by manipulating emotions rather than providing substantial evidence or logical reasoning. the appeal here is to the positive emotion of hope in order to make the argument appear reasonable.

step 1: appeal to emotion

step 2: nothing (as no further steps are necessary to confirm the fallacy)

answer: appeal to emotion",False
338,Our nation values freedom. That’s why we should have only state-run media. Government controlled media that aligns with our national values will keep our citizens free from foreign influences and disinformation.,equivocation,answer: appeal to fear,False
339,My priority is stabilizing the city’s economy. That’s why implementing rent-stabilized housing will be my first action in office.,equivocation,"step 1: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)
step 2: slippery slope fallacy (the argument implies that not implementing rent-stabilized housing could lead to economic instability without providing evidence for this claim)
step 3: circular reasoning (the statement's conclusion is based on the premise of stabilizing the economy, but the premise itself depends on the conclusion: implementing rent-stabilized housing)
step 4: nothing (there are no other fallacies present in this statement after considering each step)

answer: circular reasoning",False
340,With the economy being so unpredictable they say it’s important to choose solid investments. That’s why I'm going for tangible assets like gold and silver. At the end of the day I’ll be left with something solid that I can hold in my hands.,equivocation,"step 1: appeal to tradition
reasoning: the argument suggests that investing in gold and silver is a traditional way to secure investments, which implies that it has been proven effective throughout history. however, this does not guarantee its effectiveness in the current unpredictable economy.

step 2: fallacy of division
reasoning: just because an investment can be held physically does not mean that it will provide consistent returns or remain solid during economic downturns.

step 3: nothing (no further steps are required as the previous two steps have identified the fallacies present in the statement)

answer: fallacy of division, appeal to tradition",False
341,I want to be absolutely clear with the people of the world: the United States does not torture.,equivocation,"initial thoughts: the statement appears to use an appeal to authority, as it claims that the united states (or more specifically, the us government) does not torture. however, this claim is made without any specific evidence or citation of who this authority is.

step 1: appeal to (false) authority - the speaker is claiming to be speaking on behalf of an authority but there is no clear indication of who that authority actually is.

step 2: it seems the statement is also attempting to sway people's emotions in a positive direction, by appealing to their desire for the united states to not engage in such practices.

step 3: upon closer examination, it appears that there have been multiple allegations and investigations into torture practices by the us government in the past. therefore, the statement may be an attempt to distract from the truth (the appeal to pity fallacy), as well as using an appeal to positive emotion.

final answer: the statement uses both the appeal to pity fallacy and the appeal to positive emotion fallacy.",False
342,Veganism is the best for people who sell vegan food.,equivocation,"step 1: appeal to self-interest fallacy (the expert who makes this argument benefits from promoting veganism as the best option for those selling vegan food)
step 2: circular reasoning (the argument implies that if one sells vegan food, they are a vegan and therefore should support veganism, but this premise relies on the conclusion to be valid)
step 3: appeal to tradition fallacy (veganism as a diet has not been around long enough to have a traditional status)
step 4: nothing (since no agreement could be reached among the experts)",False
343,The theory of evolution is just a theory and should not be treated as fact.,equivocation,"step 1 (expert 1): the statement uses equivocation, as the term ""theory"" is being used in two different senses: scientific theory versus an unproven guess or hypothesis.
step 2 (expert 2): the statement also appeals to fear by implying that accepting evolution as fact could lead to uncertainty or instability.
step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, the statement is using circular reasoning in assuming that because it's a theory, it cannot be treated as fact, while treating this very assumption as a fact itself.
answer: circular reasoning, equivocation, appeal to fear",True
344,I saw her standing on the bank. Therefore she must be rich.,equivocation,"step 1 (expert 1): equivocation
step 2 (expert 2): the term ""bank"" can refer to both a financial institution and a physical location by a river. here, the arguer is equivocating between these two different meanings of the word.
step 3 (expert 3): additionally, there is no logical connection between standing on a bank (physical location) and being rich.
answer: equivocation",True
345,The sign said 'fine for parking here' so I parked here and now I have to pay a fine.,equivocation,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

1st expert: the term ""here"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to the specific location indicated by the sign or any other place nearby.

2nd expert: the sign did not specify that the location referred to was only the exact spot where the person parked. therefore, the person might have assumed a larger area was intended.

3rd expert: the sign did not indicate that there were no other parking areas close by; it merely specified ""here."" thus, the ambiguity of the term ""here"" leads to an equivocation fallacy.",True
346,We observe evolution so evolution must be true.,equivocation,"step 1: observation (empirical evidence) is being used in this argument.
step 2: however, the conclusion drawn from the observation does not follow logically.
step 3: this argument has an unwarranted inference fallacy, as it incorrectly infers that because something is observed to be true, it must always be true without exceptions.
answer: unwarranted inference fallacy",False
347,If Hillary Clinton can't satifsy her husband what makes her think she can satifsy America?,equivocation,"this statement employs a fallacy known as ""guilt by association."" the argument infers that because hillary clinton may have struggled to satisfy her husband, she will also struggle to satisfy the nation. however, being unable to satisfy one's spouse in no way implies an inability to fulfill the needs and expectations of an entire country. therefore, the statement is misleading and incorrect as it equates two unrelated situations, creating a fallacy of guilt by association.

final answer: guilt by association",False
348,I gave you my reason but you don't listen to reason.,equivocation,"'answer: appeal to anger'

explanation step 1: the statement is emotionally charged, using the words ""you don't listen to reason.""
explanation step 2: the statement's purpose is to manipulate the listener's emotions of anger and frustration by making it seem that the speaker is not being heard or respected.
explanation step 3: this is an attempt to justify an unreasonable argument using emotional reasoning, which falls under the category of 'appeal to anger'.",False
349,"The United States is the richest country in the world. Therefore, everyone in the United States must be rich and live well.",fallacy of division,"initial classification: appeal to authority (fallacy of hasty generalization)
explanation: the claim that ""everyone in the united states must be rich and live well"" because it is a rich country does not consider other factors such as poverty, wealth distribution, personal circumstances, etc.

second classification: fallacy of composition
explanation: the fallacy of composition occurs when a property that holds for one or some members of a group is incorrectly assumed to hold for the group itself. in this case, the wealth of a country (the whole) does not automatically guarantee the wealth of each individual within it (the parts).

final answer: fallacy of composition",False
350,"Because professional sports players are paid outrageous salaries, every professional sports player must be rich",fallacy of division,answer: fallacy of division,True
351,"Australian people are good at surfing. Matt is Australian. Therefore, Matt is good at surfing",fallacy of division,"step 1 (expert 1): this argument is an example of the fallacy known as 'appeal to identity'. the conclusion assumes that because someone belongs to a certain group (in this case, being australian), they must possess a specific characteristic or trait (being good at surfing).

step 2 (expert 2): however, there are exceptions and individuals who may not share the presumed common traits of their groups. not all australians are proficient surfers.

step 3 (expert 3): therefore, it cannot be logically assumed that matt is good at surfing based solely on his nationality.

answer: nothing (no fallacy was present in the argument as stated)",False
352,"Houses are made of atoms, and houses are visible. Therefore, atoms must be visible.",fallacy of division,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: the argument infers that something is true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole. (fallacy of division)

expert 2: the size of the whole (the house) is not directly related to the size of every part of the house, specifically the visibility of atoms. (fallacy of division)

expert 3: this argument is a result of the fallacy of division because it assumes that visible properties of the house apply to the invisible parts like atoms.",True
353,"Matt must be happy - I think this because he is Finnish, and Finland is the happiest country in the world",fallacy of division,"step 1 (matt): this statement uses appeal to tradition as it assumes that because finland is currently the happiest country, matt being finnish means he will also be happy.

step 2 (experts 1 & 2): the argument infers that something is true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole, which makes it fallacy of division.

final answer: answer: fallacy of division",True
354,"Given Google’s track record of groundbreaking technology, it’s safe to assume that any new product from Google is destined to become a fundamental part of our daily lives.",fallacy of division,"answer: appeal to authority (fallacy)

expert 1: this statement implies that because google has a history of creating groundbreaking technology, their new products will automatically be significant in our daily lives. however, this assumes that every product they release will have the same impact as previous ones without providing any evidence or reason for this assumption.

expert 2: the argument uses the successes and reputation of google to support its claim about a future product. but it is not necessarily an authority on whether their new products will become fundamental parts of our daily lives, since that depends on various factors such as user acceptance, competition, and market trends.

expert 3: although google has been successful in the past, there are many other companies with strong track records that have had less impact or failed to meet expectations for their new products. this statement oversimplifies the complex nature of product development and assumes that history always repeats itself, which is not guaranteed.",False
355,"Ancient Greece was a cradle of philosophy, producing great thinkers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. This suggests that every individual in Ancient Greece must have been deeply philosophical and engaged in high-level intellectual activities.",fallacy of division,"answer: fallacy of division

step 1 - identify the argument: the statement is making a generalization from a part to the whole.

step 2 - determine if the premise is true: it is true that ancient greece was a cradle of philosophy, producing great thinkers. however, this does not mean every individual in ancient greece was philosophical or intellectually engaged.

step 3 - evaluate the conclusion: the conclusion is incorrect because not every individual in ancient greece was deeply philosophical and engaged in high-level intellectual activities.",True
356,"Overall, the food in our lunchroom is healthy and receives high ratings from the health department. So, the chocolate chip cookies that they are serving must be healthy for me!",fallacy of division,"answer: fallacy of division

step 1 (expert 1): the argument infers something is true of one or more of the parts from the fact that it is true of the whole. (the overall food in the lunchroom is healthy, but this does not necessarily mean the chocolate chip cookies are healthy).

step 2 (expert 2): the size and health ratings of other foods do not prove that the chocolate chip cookies are healthy. (the fact that the entire lunchroom's food is rated as healthy doesn’t mean that every single food item within it is healthy too).

step 3 (expert 3): it is possible for some items in a group to be unhealthy despite the overall group being considered healthy. (even if the health department has given high ratings to the majority of foods, it doesn't guarantee that every single food item within it is necessarily healthy).",True
357,"The German train system is reliable, I think my train is going to be on time.",fallacy of division,"initial thoughts: appeal to authority (the expert here is the speaker themselves, based on their belief about the reliability of the german train system)

second thoughts: circular reasoning (the reliability of the german train system is inferred from the assumption that the speaker's train will be on time)

final answer: circular reasoning",False
358,My mom makes less money than my dad because women in the United States are paid less than men.,fallacy of division,answer: appeal to tradition,False
359,"The boys in my neighborhood like to play basketball after school. So my new neighbor, Kevin, will like to play basketball with them.",fallacy of division,"step 1: appeal to tradition (using historical preferences of a group as evidence that the historical preference is correct)
step 2: fallacy of division (inferring that something is true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole)
final answer: appeal to tradition and fallacy of division",True
360,"I just read a report about teachers not being happy with how much they are paid. So, my Aunt Sarah who is a teacher must be unhappy with her salary.",fallacy of division,"step 1 (expert 1): this argument appears to be an example of 'appeal to tradition' fallacy, because the assumption is made that just because all teachers might generally be unhappy about their pay, it means that this specific individual (aunt sarah) shares the same feeling.

step 2 (expert 2): however, there's no evidence provided in the argument to show a direct connection between aunt sarah and the group of teachers mentioned. therefore, we should consider 'fallacy of division.'

step 3 (expert 3): upon further review, i agree with expert 2 that it's an instance of 'fallacy of division.' the argument jumps to a conclusion about one individual based on information about a larger group without adequate evidence.

answer: fallacy of division",True
361,"The universe has existed for fifteen billion years. The universe is made out of molecules. Therefore, each of the molecules in the universe has existed for fifteen billion years.",fallacy of division,answer: fallacy of division,True
362,"In the Holy Church, all priests must be Holy.",fallacy of division,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to authority fallacy, as the claim that all priests must be holy is based on the assumption that the holy church is an authoritative source on holiness.

step 2 (expert 2): circular reasoning fallacy, since the conclusion (all priests must be holy) is derived from the premise that the holy church is a holy authority, which itself assumes that all priests are holy.

step 3 (expert 3): guilt by association fallacy, as the argument equates holiness with priesthood, implying that being associated with the church implies being holy.

answer: guilt by association fallacy",False
363,"His house is about half the size of most houses in the neighborhood. Therefore, his doors must all be about 3 1/2 feet high.",fallacy of division,"answer: fallacy of division

step 1: recognizing that the argument infers a relationship between the whole (the house) and its parts (doors).

step 2: understanding that the size of one’s house does not necessarily imply the same proportions for every part, including doors.

step 3: identifying that the conclusion is an incorrect assumption based on the premise.",True
364,"I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up.  Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!",fallacy of division,"answer: guilt by association

expert 1: the argument uses a negative association with the catholic church to make an unwarranted judgment about an individual unrelated to the scandal.

expert 2: the conclusion about the neighbor's guilt is not based on evidence or facts related to the neighbor themselves, only their association with the church.

expert 3: the premise of the argument assumes that everyone who belongs to the same group as those involved in the scandal are guilty by default.

final answer: guilt by association",False
365,"Healthy brains think. Healthy brains are comprised of nothing but brain cells. If healthy brains think, then the individual brain cells can think too.",fallacy of division,"answer: fallacy of division

step 1 (first expert): the premise is that healthy brains think and they are composed of brain cells. this suggests that if healthy brains think, then the individual brain cells can also think.

step 2 (second expert): however, the fact that one larger entity (in this case, the brain) has a particular function or characteristic does not necessarily mean that each part of it (the individual brain cells) will share the same function or characteristic.

step 3 (third expert): the conclusion drawn, that the individual brain cells can think too, is an incorrect inference based on the assumption that if the whole (healthy brains) have a certain ability (to think), then each part of it (individual brain cells) must also possess that same ability. this is an example of the fallacy of division.",True
366,"Renewables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.",false analogy,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the argument seems to be that renewable energy sources like wind turbines are environmentally harmful due to several reasons - pollution, bird/bat deaths, harm to insects, health problems in humans, toxins, and landscapes despoilment. however, the conclusion of the argument is still based on these same factors - environmental disastrousness, which makes it a circular reasoning fallacy.

expert 2: the initial expert has pointed out that the conclusion is derived from the premises themselves, thus creating a closed loop in reasoning. to add, the language used like ""disastrous"" and ""despoilment"" are also being repeated throughout the argument without proper justification or evidence.

expert 3: agree with expert 1 and expert 2 that the argument is based on circular reasoning. additionally, the use of loaded language can be seen as an attempt to appeal to emotions instead of providing evidence-based facts to support the claim about renewable energy sources being environmentally harmful. this could potentially mislead readers into accepting the conclusion without critical examination.",False
367,"Like countless other organisms, we move and adapt when the environment changes. Species thrive when it is warm.",false analogy,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: the argument infers that because species thrive when it's warm, individual organisms within those species must always thrive in warmer environments.

expert 2: however, the fact that a species as a whole does well in warmer temperatures doesn’t guarantee that every single individual will. for instance, some individuals might be adapted to colder climates.

expert 3: additionally, the argument ignores external factors such as food availability, predators, and other environmental conditions which can greatly impact an organism's survival, regardless of temperature.",False
368,"You’ve only got to look at Singapore. It’s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change, and it’s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in.",false analogy,"answer: appeal to worse problems

expert 1: the argument is comparing a city (singapore) with a hypothetical worst-case scenario for climate change, attempting to make singapore seem better by this comparison.

expert 2: the comparison of the current state of singapore with a worst-case scenario for climate change doesn't validate that living conditions in singapore are superior.

expert 3: the use of a worst-case scenario in an attempt to highlight the positive aspects of singapore does not make it a desirable city to live in, as the comparison is irrelevant to the actual quality of life.",False
369,"Venus, which was once a very Earth-like planet with plenty of life-supporting water before runaway climate change rapidly transformed it into an arid and uninhabitable sphere enveloped in an unbreathable gas.",false analogy,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation: step 1 (venus): the statement mentions that venus was once earth-like, but then goes on to claim that it became uninhabitable due to runaway climate change. however, the initial condition of venus being earth-like is used as evidence for its later transformation into an inhospitable planet, creating a circular argument where the premise supports the conclusion, and vice versa.

step 2 (venus): the statement further implies that venus was transformed into an arid and unbreathable sphere due to runaway climate change, but does not provide any evidence or explanation for this rapid transformation.

step 3 (expert 1): it seems reasonable to question if there is enough information provided in the statement to draw a conclusion about the cause of venus' transformation.

step 4 (expert 2): if more context and evidence were given, it might be possible to determine whether this rapid climate change was indeed responsible for venus' current state. however, without such information, it is unjustified to assume that runaway climate change was the only or primary cause of the transformation.

step 5 (expert 3): given that there is no additional evidence provided in the statement to support the claim about the rapid and catastrophic climate change on venus, the argument remains circular, as it uses the conclusion (venus became uninhabitable) to prove the premise (venus was transformed by runaway climate change).",False
370,"They do know that in acid waters, oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells, and that when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans’ pH has over the past generation, it induces seizures, comas, and sudden death.",false analogy,"answer: appeal to emotion

explanation (step 1): the statement uses the emotion of pity to make the argument more compelling, rather than providing evidence or reasoning for the conclusion.",False
371,"Renewables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.",false analogy,"answer: appeal to emotion
explanation step 1: the argument focuses on emotional appeals such as environmental destruction, animal deaths, health problems, and landscape despoiling rather than providing evidence or facts.
explanation step 2: there is no mention of actual studies or scientific data that demonstrate the harm caused by wind turbines to the environment or human health.
explanation step 3: the argument tries to provoke strong emotions against wind turbines without presenting any supporting evidence, relying on emotional appeals rather than factual analysis.
explanation step 4: no further disagreement among experts as they all agree that the reasoning used in this statement is an appeal to emotion fallacy.",False
372,"Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.",false analogy,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: the statement talks about the addition of co2 molecules to the atmosphere, but it only focuses on the initial impact and assumes that each additional molecule would have the same level of impact. this is a fallacy of division since it infers something is true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole.

expert 2: the argument uses an analogy comparing adding co2 molecules to painting over a wall, but the analogy is not directly applicable to the real-world situation being described. this analogy does not hold enough weight as evidence to support the claim made.

expert 3: the statement assumes that the warming impact of each additional co2 molecule added to the atmosphere will have a significantly reduced effect, similar to how additional coats of paint have less of an effect on concealing the base color. however, this is not necessarily true in real-world scenarios, as many factors can influence climate change and their interactions are complex and not always straightforward or predictable. this statement oversimplifies the issue and commits a fallacy of division by inferring something is true for parts based on the whole.

answer: fallacy of division",False
373,"It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America.",false analogy,"step 1: appeal to tradition (using historical preferences as evidence)
step 2: fallacy of division (infers that something is true of one or more of the parts from the fact that it is true of the whole)
answer: answer: appeal to tradition and fallacy of division",False
374,"No one objects to a physician looking up a difficult case in medical books. Why, then, shouldn't students taking a difficult examination be permitted to use their textbooks?",false analogy,"answer: appeal to false authority

explanation step 1 (expert 1): the argument uses a type of person as evidence for the claim, which is not an expert in this context.
explanation step 2 (expert 2): the argument assumes that the people taking the examination are equivalent to students who would be studying from textbooks, ignoring the possibility that they may have other resources or methods of learning available to them.
explanation step 3 (expert 3): the argument assumes that using a textbook during an examination is justifiable because a physician can do so when dealing with a difficult case, without considering whether the two situations are comparable in terms of the nature and purpose of the task at hand.
explanation step 4 (all experts): the argument relies on an assumption that the authority of a physician in one context can be extended to students taking an examination, which is not supported by evidence or reasonable comparison, making it an appeal to false authority fallacy.",False
375,People who have to have a cup of coffee every morning before they can function have no less a problem than alcoholics who have to have their alcohol each day to sustain them.,false analogy,"answer: appeal to analogy
explanation: the statement compares people who drink coffee daily to alcoholics, but it does not provide evidence or reasoning to support that the two are similar enough for the comparison to be meaningful and valid.",False
376,"If somebody has a cure for cancer, would you reject it because it was somebody you may not like who came up with it?",false analogy,"'answer: guilt by association'

step 1: the statement suggests that one might reject a potential cure for cancer based on personal feelings towards the person who discovered it. this implies that the quality or validity of the discovery is affected by one's opinion of the discoverer, which is not logically sound.

step 2: the reasoning behind this fallacy is the idea that a negative association with the person (in this case dislike) somehow delegitimizes their work, which is irrelevant to the objectivity and truthfulness of the discovery itself.

step 3: the experts would then discuss how this line of thinking disregards the fact that one should judge the merits of a discovery on its own merits, rather than basing it on personal feelings towards the discoverer. they would also discuss how this kind of reasoning is not only illogical but could potentially hinder important scientific advancements.

step 4: the experts would agree that the fallacy being committed in this scenario is 'guilt by association', as it involves judging something negatively due to its connection with a person or group already viewed negatively, in this case, someone who may be disliked.",False
377,To say humans are immortal is like saying a car can run forever.,false analogy,"answer: fallacy of analogy
explanation (expert 1): humans and cars are different entities, hence comparing them in such a way that suggests humans have an infinite lifespan (immortality) is not valid.

explanation (expert 2): the comparison of two entirely dissimilar things (humans and cars) is flawed because it assumes the same rules or properties apply to both, which may not be the case.

explanation (expert 3): the argument is based on an analogy between two unrelated entities (humans and cars), leading to a conclusion that does not hold up logically.",False
378,Making people register their own guns is like the Nazis making the Jews register with their government. This policy is crazy.,false analogy,answer: guilt by association,False
379,"If one were to listen to only one kind of music or eat only one kind of food, it would soon become tasteless or boring. Variety makes eating and listening exciting and enriching experiences. So it seems to me that an exclusive sexual relationship with only one partner for the rest of ones life, that is, marriage, does not hold out much hope for very much excitement or enrichment.",false analogy,"answer: appeal to tradition

expert 1: the argument suggests that because something has been done in a certain way in the past (marriage as exclusive sexual relationship with only one partner), it should continue to be done this way now. this is an appeal to tradition fallacy.

expert 2: the argument does not provide any reasons or evidence as to why marriage needs to be exciting or enriching. instead, it relies on the assumption that people in a marriage will become bored if they only have one partner for life, which is based on personal opinion rather than fact.

expert 3: the argument also implies that variety is necessary for excitement and enrichment in eating and listening experiences. however, this is not necessarily true as many people enjoy consistent and traditional meals or music genres. therefore, the argument does not hold up as a universal truth.",False
380,"Smoking cigarettes is just like ingesting arsenic into your system. Both have been shown to be causally related to death. So if you wouldn't want to take a spoonful of arsenic, I would think that you wouldn't want to continue smoking.",false analogy,"answer: false analogy

expert 1: this statement is making an analogy between two things (smoking cigarettes and ingesting arsenic) to make a point about their similarities.

expert 2: however, the comparison made here is not accurate because smoking cigarettes and ingesting arsenic are not equivalent in terms of how they affect the human body or in other relevant ways.

expert 3: therefor, the statement uses a false analogy to make its point.",True
381,"Because human bodies become less active as they grow older, and because they eventually die, it is reasonable to expect that political bodies will become less and less active the longer they are in existence, and that they too will eventually die.",false analogy,"answer: appeal to false analogy

explanation: step 1 - the argument compares two different types of entities (human bodies and political bodies) on a similarity basis (they both exist and eventually cease to be). however, the connection between these entities is not supported by any evidence or reason, making it an analogy.
step 2 - the argument then infers that because one type of entity behaves in a certain way, the other type will also behave in the same way. this is false because human bodies and political bodies are fundamentally different, and their lifespans, activities, and causes of death can differ greatly.
step 3 - since the argument relies on an unjustified comparison to support its conclusion, it is considered an appeal to false analogy fallacy.",True
382,People who buy stocks are no different from people who bet on horse racing. They both risk their money with little chance of making a big profit.,false analogy,"answer: appeal to false authority

explanation step 1 (expert 1): the statement is making a comparison between people who buy stocks and people who bet on horse racing, implying that they are similar in some way.

explanation step 2 (expert 2): however, the statement is not supported by any evidence or reasoning as to why these two groups are actually similar, so it's making an assumption without justification.

explanation step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, the idea that buying stocks and betting on horse racing are analogous requires authority from someone who has expertise in both fields. but if there is no such expert to support this comparison, then it becomes a fallacious argument.

explanation step 4 (all experts): since the statement lacks evidence or justification for the similarity between buying stocks and betting on horse racing, and also since it assumes an expertise that does not exist in any single individual, we have reached our final agreement: answer: appeal to false authority.",False
383,"Raising children is like training pets. If you can handle a dog, you can handle a child.",false analogy,"initial thoughts: this statement suggests an analogy between raising children and training pets, implying that they are similar enough for someone who can manage one to manage the other. however, there seems to be no evidence or reason provided to support this claim.

first expert: this is an example of a fallacy known as 'equivocation'. the term 'raising' implies tending and caring for another living being, but it does not necessarily mean training or controlling them.

second expert: while the two actions might have similarities in some aspects (e.g., providing food, shelter, and love), they differ significantly in other areas such as cognitive ability, communication skills, and social development. therefore, we cannot conclude that someone capable of handling a dog can handle a child without further evidence or reasoning.

third expert: moreover, the assumption that the two tasks are similar enough to require the same skills ignores important differences between pets (domestic animals) and children (human beings), such as the complexities of human emotions, reasoning capabilities, and legal protections in place for the well-being of children.

final agreement: answer: equivocation",False
384,Switching from gasoline cars to electric cars is like trading cigarettes for e-cigarettes; both are harmful in the long run.,false analogy,"answer: fallacy of false analogy

expert 1: this statement makes a comparison between two things (gasoline cars and e-cigarettes) but doesn't provide evidence that they have similar harmful effects in the long run.

expert 2: the argument assumes that because both items are harmful initially, they will remain so indefinitely, which is not necessarily true for all cases.

expert 3: there might be other aspects to consider when comparing gasoline cars and e-cigarettes, such as the overall health impacts of each over time, but this comparison fails to address those factors.",True
385,"Using antibiotics to treat bacterial infections is just like using pesticides in agriculture. Both create stronger, resistant strains of the original problem.",false analogy,"answer: appeal to analogy (or false analogy)

expert 1: the statement compares two different situations and argues that because one leads to a certain outcome, the other will too. this is an example of an appeal to analogy or false analogy fallacy.
expert 2: the comparison is based on the assumption that antibiotics work similarly to pesticides in agriculture, but there may not be enough evidence to support this claim. the use of antibiotics and pesticides are two different things, each with their own unique mechanisms and effects.
expert 3: the conclusion that using antibiotics will lead to resistant strains based on the similarities between antibiotics and pesticides is an unwarranted generalization, not grounded in evidence. therefore, it represents a fallacy of reasoning.",True
386,Allowing people to choose their own work hours is like letting students choose their own school subjects. Both lead to a lack of discipline and poor results.,false analogy,"answer: circular reasoning

step 1 (expert a): the argument compares two situations, but the conclusion relies on the assumption that both situations have the same outcome (lack of discipline and poor results). this means the conclusion is used as evidence in the premise, creating a circular reasoning.

step 2 (expert b): the claim made that allowing people to choose their work hours leads to a lack of discipline and poor results is not substantiated by any evidence or data, it's just an assumption based on the comparison with another situation that also has no supporting evidence.

step 3 (expert c): there is no mention of fear, false authority, appeal to worse problems, straw man fallacy, guilt by association, appeal to anger, equivocation, fallacy of division, tu quoque, or appeal to positive emotion in this statement, so it doesn't fit any of those classifications.

step 4 (expert a): since the argument is based on a circular reasoning and there are no other applicable fallacies mentioned, the final answer is 'answer: circular reasoning'.",False
387,"Maintaining a healthy diet is like maintaining a well-oiled machine. Just as machines need regular oil changes to run smoothly, humans need consistent diets to function properly.",false analogy,"answer: appeal to analogy

explanation (step 1): the argument compares two things (machines and humans) to make a point about one of them (humans). however, the comparison is not perfect, as machines can run on oil changes alone while humans require more complex nutritional needs.

explanation (step 2): while it is true that both machines and humans need maintenance for optimal performance, the analogy does not provide a complete or accurate picture of what is required for human health, leading to an oversimplification of the situation.

explanation (step 3): as the comparison between machines and humans is not perfect, it can lead people to misunderstand the real reasons why maintaining a healthy diet is important, as well as what specifically should be included in that diet.

explanation (step 4): the final agreement would be reached by acknowledging that while there are similarities between machines and humans, they have distinct differences when it comes to their maintenance requirements, making the analogy incomplete and potentially misleading.",False
388,Implementing strict immigration policies is like securing your home with high fences and locks. Both keep out unwanted intruders and protect what's inside.,false analogy,"this statement utilizes the fallacy known as ""analogy"". the argument compares implementing strict immigration policies to securing one's home, suggesting that both serve similar purposes: keeping out undesirable elements while protecting what's within. however, the analogy is flawed because not all aspects of implementing immigration policies are analogous to securing a home; there are essential differences in terms of individual rights, societal impact, and more.

when comparing the experts' reasoning:

1st expert: the argument employs an analogy. it compares two different concepts and assumes they share similar characteristics.
2nd expert: however, the comparison lacks justification since implementing immigration policies and securing a home are not equivalent in many ways, such as legal frameworks, human rights considerations, and societal consequences.
3rd expert: furthermore, the argument does not take into account exceptions or nuances that exist within both contexts (e.g., refugees seeking asylum or legitimate visitors).

finally, all experts agree that the statement employs an ""analogy"" fallacy since it makes unwarranted comparisons between unrelated concepts without considering essential differences and exceptions.",False
389,Requiring vaccinations for schoolchildren is like forcing everyone to wear seat belts. Both infringe on personal freedoms under the guise of safety.,false analogy,"answer: false analogy
explanation (step 1): the argument uses two different situations and draws a comparison between them, but it does not provide sufficient evidence or reasoning to show that they are similar enough to be considered analogous.
explanation (step 2): the requirement of vaccinations and the use of seat belts address different issues: personal health vs safety in vehicle travel. they do not infringe on freedom to the same degree nor share the same justification or consequences.
explanation (step 3): both requirements have different goals, impacts, and reasons for implementation, making them fundamentally different situations.",True
390,"Social media platforms are like public parks. If we regulate speech on social media, it’s the same as regulating conversations in public parks.",false analogy,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement is an example of an appeal to analogy fallacy. the argument compares two different things (social media and public parks) without showing a clear connection or equivalence between them.

step 2 (expert 2): the comparison fails to account for the unique aspects of each context, such as the nature of online speech versus face-to-face conversations in a park.

step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, the argument does not provide any basis for believing that regulating one necessarily leads to the regulation of the other.

final answer: answer: appeal to analogy",False
391,Learning a new language as an adult is like learning to walk again after an injury. Both are nearly impossible without constant practice and patience.,false analogy,"the statement presents the fallacy of equivocation.

expert 1: the phrase ""learning to walk again"" can mean regaining locomotion after an injury, which is different from learning a new language.
expert 2: however, in this context, it seems the author means that learning a new language requires similar effort as learning to walk after an injury - perseverance and patience. the word ""walk"" has been used ambiguously in two different senses.

answer: equivocation",False
392,Allowing employees to work from home permanently is like allowing them to take a permanent vacation. Both will lead to a drop in productivity and accountability.,false analogy,"answer: appeal to analogy

explanation (step 1 - expert 1): the argument compares two different situations without providing sufficient evidence to show that the consequences are the same.

explanation (step 2 - expert 2): while it's true that working from home and taking a permanent vacation may affect productivity, there is no solid justification given for why they would lead to an identical drop in productivity and accountability.

explanation (step 3 - expert 3): the argument fails to consider individual circumstances, such as employee motivation, work environment, and company policies that can influence productivity when working remotely. therefore, it's not accurate to claim that both situations will always have the same effects on productivity and accountability.

final answer: appeal to analogy",False
393,Whenever I wear my lucky jersey my team loses. So it must actually be my unlucky jersey,false causality,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems like an example of the fallacy called ""post hoc ergo propter hoc"" (latin for 'after this, therefore because of this'). the person is inferring that because the event a (wearing the lucky jersey) occurred before the event b (the team loses), then b was caused by a. however, there might be other factors at play that could have caused the team to lose.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement also appears to contain a form of superstition, assuming that there is some magical or unproven force associated with the jersey causing bad luck.

step 3 (expert 3): upon closer inspection, it seems that the person's belief in the lucky/unlucky nature of the jersey could be classified as an example of ""appeal to magic"" or ""anecdotal evidence."" the reasoning behind this is that they are attributing the team's performance to something unproven and based on personal experiences, rather than objective facts.

step 4 (expert 1): upon reviewing all the points presented, it seems that our experts have reached a final agreement. 'answer: appeal to magic'",False
394,She shouldn't have stopped for coffee on the way to work. If she hadn't stopped she wouldn't have had a fender bender.,false causality,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: the argument infers that because one action (stopping for coffee) led to an event (fender bender), then it must be the cause of the event. this is a fallacy because not all actions that lead to a certain event are necessarily the cause of that event.

expert 2: however, the argument does imply a causal relationship between stopping for coffee and having a fender bender, which makes this fallacy under the category of fallacy of division. the size of one’s house almost certainly does not mean that the doors will be smaller, especially by the same proportions.

expert 3: although it might seem like we are dealing with causation, we aren't discussing if stopping for coffee directly caused the accident but rather whether one event (stopping for coffee) led to another (fender bender). therefore, we can categorize this as fallacy of division.",False
395,Every time they see a rainbow in the sky something good happens. So whenever something good happens they know there must be a rainbow.,false causality,"answer: fallacy of causality

expert 1: the fact that a rainbow is seen does not necessarily mean it caused the good event to happen. (fallacy of causality)

expert 2: the observation of a rainbow does not provide enough evidence to conclude that it causes good events to occur, as many other factors may have played a role in the good event happening. (confirmation bias)

expert 3: the conclusion that a rainbow is the cause of a good event is not based on empirical evidence or testing, only on anecdotal observations. (appeal to anecdote)

expert 1: indeed, the conclusion was drawn without any experimental testing or control groups, relying solely on personal observations. (lack of empirical evidence)

expert 2: furthermore, it is not possible to scientifically prove that a rainbow's existence directly causes good events, as there are multiple variables at play in any given situation. (complex causality)

expert 3: in addition, the correlation between seeing a rainbow and good events may simply be coincidental rather than causal. (correlation does not imply causation)

expert 1: yes, it is possible that the correlation is merely coincidental, or that other factors are at play in both the appearance of the rainbow and the subsequent good event. (confounding variables)

expert 2: agreed, as there may be other explanations for the observed correlation that do not involve a causal relationship between rainbows and good events. (alternative hypotheses)

expert 3: therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that seeing a rainbow causes good events to happen, only that the two phenomena may occur together. (correlation does not imply causation)

answer: fallacy of causality",False
396,Our state stopped observing Daylight Saving Time and now it seems like more bugs are out. We shouldn’t have stopped observing Daylight Saving Time.,false causality,"initial thoughts:
1. appeal to fear: the argument is using the fear of increased bugs as a primary motivator to reverse the decision on observing daylight saving time.
2. fallacy of division: the argument assumes that because more bugs are out, it means that the decision to stop observing daylight saving time was incorrect.
3. nothing: there is no clear appeal to authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, straw man fallacy, equivocation, tu quoque, appeal to positive emotion in this argument.

second thoughts:
1. appeal to fear (confirmed): the fear of increased bugs is used as the primary motivator for reversing the decision on daylight saving time.
2. fallacy of division (confirmed): the argument assumes that because more bugs are out, it means that the decision to stop observing daylight saving time was incorrect.
3. nothing (reaffirmed): there is no clear appeal to authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, straw man fallacy, equivocation, tu quoque, appeal to positive emotion in this argument.

398,Every time I buy a good seat for a game my team wins. Everytime I buy a cheap seat they lose. I better get a good seat for the next game if I want to see my team win the championship!,false causality,"step 1: fallacy of division
step 2: the reasoning is assuming that because one part (buying a good seat) has an effect on the outcome, all other parts will also have the same effect. this is incorrect as there may be many other factors that influence the game's outcome beyond seating arrangements.
step 3: the conclusion (getting a good seat for the next game to see the team win the championship) is not supported by any evidence or reason.
answer: fallacy of division",False
399,I’ve noticed that every time I sleep with my shoes on I wake up with a headache. I’m convinced that sleeping with one’s shoes on causes a headache.,false causality,"step 1: appeal to cause and effect fallacy (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc). the person is assuming that because event a (sleeping with shoes on) preceded event b (waking up with a headache), then a caused b. however, there may be other factors at play that are causing the headache, such as sleeping position, stress, or allergies.

step 2: no clear indication of fear being used as a primary motivator, so no appeal to fear fallacy.

step 3: no clear indication of false authority being used, so no appeal to (false) authority fallacy.

step 4: the person is not making a comparison to the worst case scenario, so no appeal to worse problems fallacy.

step 5: the argument does not rely on its own premise for support, so no circular reasoning fallacy.

step 6: the person is not associating themselves with a negative figure to make a negative claim about themselves, so no guilt by association fallacy.

step 7: no clear indication of anger being used as evidence in the argument, so no appeal to anger fallacy.

step 8: the person is not misrepresenting or distorting another's position, so no straw man fallacy.

step 9: the person is not appealing to historical preferences as evidence for their argument, so no appeal to tradition fallacy.

step 10: the person is not using the word ""gay"" in a homosexual context, but rather in a lighthearted or joyful context, so no equivocation fallacy.

step 11: the person is making an assumption about the size of the doors based on the size of the house, so fallacy of division fallacy.

step 12: the person is using the fact that they do not follow their own advice as a criticism against that advice, so tu quoque fallacy.

step 13: the person is trying to appeal to positive emotions (happiness) in order to make their argument seem reasonable, so appeal to positive emotion fallacy.

step 14: the person is using pity as a means of distraction from the truth of the conclusion, so appeal to pity fallacy.

answer: appeal to cause and effect fallacy (post hoc ergo propter hoc) and tu quoque fallacy.",False
400,Ever since I started wearing this crystal necklace I’ve been extremely lucky. I’ve even aced all my exams. This necklace is my lucky charm.,false causality,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to anecdote - the argument is based on a single incident or observation, and draws a conclusion that cannot be logically justified from this evidence alone.

step 2 (expert 2): post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy - the correlation between wearing the necklace and doing well in exams does not prove causation. there may be other factors at play, such as increased self-confidence or hard work, that are responsible for the good grades.

step 3 (expert 3): nothing - in this case, the argument does not clearly fit any of the described fallacies, but rather it is an example of a non-logical and unscientific reasoning based on superstition.

answer: post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy (if we follow expert 1's definition, as it covers both the appeal to anecdote and the correlation vs causation issue)",False
401,I swear every time I wash my car it rains the next day. It's like the universe is playing a prank on me. I'd better not wash my car the day before we go to the beach.,false causality,"answer: appeal to anecdote (also known as appeal to experience)

step 1: the statement presents a personal experience (the speaker washing their car and it raining the next day).

step 2: this personal experience is then used to make a broader claim about the universe playing a prank on them, which goes beyond the scope of the personal experience.

step 3: the conclusion that not washing the car before going to the beach will prevent rain is an inference based on the original experience and not supported by evidence or reason.",False
402,So I moved my furniture around last week and wouldn't you know it - I got a promotion at work. Maybe I should become an interior decorator.,false causality,"step 1: correlation does not imply causation (fallacy)
- the rearrangement of the furniture seems to have no direct connection with getting a job promotion, as one is a physical action and the other is related to employment status.

step 2: appeal to anecdote (fallacy)
- a single example or personal story is presented as evidence for a general rule or truth. while it's possible that rearranging furniture might have some impact on work performance, it doesn't provide strong support for becoming an interior decorator.

step 3: hasty generalization (fallacy)
- the suggestion that improving one's workplace environment through interior design will lead to job promotions is a broad assumption based on an isolated incident. more evidence would be needed to validate the claim as generally applicable.

step 4: nothing
- no other fallacies are evident in this statement.",False
403,Since I switched to drinking green tea my skin has cleared up. It's like nature's cure for acne.,false causality,"step 1: the statement is making a cause and effect claim (green tea -> clear skin).
step 2: however, there is no evidence or scientific proof provided that directly connects the consumption of green tea to clearer skin.
step 3: therefore, the argument is based on anecdotal evidence rather than evidence-based science, making it a form of ""appeal to anecdote"" or ""testimonial fallacy"".
answer: appeal to anecdote (or testimonial fallacy)",False
404,I prayed for good weather for my outdoor event and it didn't rain. My prayers must have caused the clear skies.,false causality,"step 1: appeal to superstition (also known as magical thinking)
reasoning: the conclusion that one's personal actions (such as praying) can directly cause an observable event (like the weather) is not supported by evidence or reason, and instead relies on a belief in supernatural forces.

step 2: there is no further reasoning needed after the first step, as all three experts agree that the statement demonstrates magical thinking or appeal to superstition.

answer: appeal to superstition",False
405,I saw a shooting star and made a wish and it came true. As if I needed more proof that shooting stars grant wishes.,false causality,"answer: appeal to anecdote

expert 1: it seems this argument is using a single personal experience (seeing a shooting star and making a wish) as evidence for a general claim (shooting stars grant wishes).
expert 2: correct, it appears that the individual's singular observation has been extrapolated to apply universally.
expert 3: yes, this is an example of using one personal experience to draw a broad conclusion without any supporting evidence or scientific backing.",False
406,I listened to classical music while studying and I got a high score on the test. Classical music must improve academic performance.,false causality,"step 1 (expert 1): this is an example of correlation implying causation fallacy, because listening to classical music while studying and getting a high score might just be coincidence, not necessarily one causing the other.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it's important to note that no evidence or reason was provided to support the claim that classical music causes better academic performance, so there is still a lack of evidence in this argument.

step 3 (expert 3): in addition, the argument does not account for other factors such as the student's study habits, motivation, or previous knowledge, which could have also contributed to their high score on the test. therefore, we cannot confidently say that classical music causes better academic performance.

answer: nothing (as the conclusion of the statement is not a fallacy)",False
407,Black cats are harbingers of misfortune. Every time I see a black cat something bad happens.,false causality,"initial thoughts: the argument seems to be making a correlation between seeing black cats and bad events happening, which could potentially be an example of the ""correlation does not imply causation"" fallacy. however, there's also a possibility that it's an appeal to anecdote, as the argument is based on personal experiences rather than empirical evidence.

second thoughts: upon further examination, the argument does not explicitly state that seeing black cats causes bad events, but rather implies it through association. this is actually closer to the ""appeal to superstition"" fallacy, as the reasoning is based on unproven beliefs or traditions.

final answer: appeal to superstition",False
408,The flu shot caused me to get COVID-19 - I tested positive for COVID-19 after getting the flu shot.,false causality,"'answer: fallacy of cause and effect'
step 1: the statement suggests that the flu shot caused the covid-19 infection, but there is no evidence or logical connection to support this claim.
step 2: the flu shot, being a vaccine, helps prevent flu infections, not covid-19.
step 3: even if one were to get sick after receiving the flu shot, it does not automatically mean that the flu shot caused the illness. many factors can lead to contracting an infection, and timing alone does not prove causation.
step 4: a correlation (getting a flu shot before getting covid-19) is being mistaken for causation (the flu shot causing covid-19).",False
409,I tested positive for COVID-19 after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine must have caused me to get infected.,false causality,"answer: fallacy of cause and effect (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc)

expert 1: this statement suggests that because one event (getting vaccinated) happened before another event (testing positive for covid-19), it must have caused the second event. however, this is an oversimplification and ignores other possible factors that could have led to the second event.

expert 2: the vaccine triggers an immune response in the body, preparing it to fight off the virus if exposed. therefore, getting vaccinated does not necessarily mean one will test positive for covid-19 afterwards, even though it happened first.

expert 3: it's important to note that the timing of events does not automatically imply causation. other factors such as exposure to infected individuals, poor masking practices, or weakened immune system could have contributed to testing positive for covid-19 after getting vaccinated.

answer: fallacy of cause and effect (post hoc ergo propter hoc)",False
410,I wore a mask and still got COVID-19. Masks must not be effective in preventing transmission.,false causality,"step 1: observation of correlation between wearing masks and contracting covid-19 (expert 1)
step 2: recognition that correlation does not imply causation (expert 2)
step 3: acknowledgement that other factors such as social distancing, hygiene practices, or pre-existing conditions could have contributed to the contraction of covid-19 (expert 3)
step 4: conclusion that drawing a cause-effect relationship based on this specific instance is incorrect and would be an example of a fallacy called 'post hoc ergo propter hoc' (expert 1 & 2)
answer: nothing",False
411,I took zinc supplements and didn't get COVID-19. Zinc must be the key to immunity against the virus.,false causality,"answer: fallacy of causality

expert 1: this statement presents a correlation but does not establish causation, as taking zinc supplements doesn't necessarily prevent someone from contracting covid-19.

expert 2: the statement infers that the only reason the individual didn't get covid-19 is because of the zinc supplements taken, disregarding other possible factors such as lifestyle choices and exposure to the virus.

expert 3: the individual may have followed precautions like wearing masks, social distancing, and washing hands, which could also contribute to not contracting covid-19, but these factors are ignored in the argument.",False
412,Extreme weather-related deaths in the U.S. have decreased by more than 98% over the last 100 years... Global warming saves lives.,false causality,"'answer: appeal to better problems'

step 1 (expert a): the argument is comparing the current situation with a worse case scenario, which is the premise of the ""appeal to worse problems"" fallacy.

step 2 (expert b): however, it does not directly argue that global warming causes the decrease in extreme weather-related deaths; instead, it implicitly suggests this correlation by claiming that global warming saves lives.

step 3 (expert c): the argument also oversimplifies the complex relationship between global warming and extreme weather events, which may have both positive and negative effects on mortality rates. additionally, other factors such as improved infrastructure, technology, and societal responses are likely to contribute to the decrease in deaths over time.

step 4 (expert a): the final conclusion is that while there might be some correlation between global warming and decreased extreme weather-related deaths, it is not justifiable to attribute the entire decline to global warming without proper evidence or considering other contributing factors. therefore, the argument fails to establish its claim due to the use of the ""appeal to worse problems"" fallacy.",False
413,Every severe recession follows a Republican Presidency; therefore Republicans are the cause of recessions.,false causality,"step 1 (expert a): correlation does not imply causation. the given statement only shows that there is a correlation between the two factors, but it does not prove that one causes the other.

step 2 (expert b): the argument lacks evidence showing a direct relationship between political party affiliation and the occurrence of severe recessions.

step 3 (expert c): no clear causal connection has been established between the two variables. the statement does not provide any supporting evidence to demonstrate that republicans are the cause of recessions.

answer: circular reasoning or appeal to correlation",False
414,“But like most claims regarding global warming the real effect is small and most likely due to natural weather patterns. Any changes in hurricanes over 70 years can easily be part of natural cycles — or incomplete data. Coastal lake sediments along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from 1000 to 2000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today.,false causality,"answer: appeal to tradition

expert 1: the claim starts with ""but like most claims regarding global warming"" which implies that there's a general consensus about global warming. however, the claim does not provide any evidence or reason for this assumption.

expert 2: the argument then introduces the idea that small changes in hurricanes over 70 years can be attributed to natural cycles or incomplete data. but it contradicts itself by suggesting that hurricane activity from 1000 to 2000 years ago shows more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today, implying a change in weather patterns over a much longer period of time.

expert 3: the argument then argues against the idea of human-induced global warming by pointing out that coastal lake sediments from 1000 to 2000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than today, which is used as evidence against recent changes in hurricane activity. however, this line of reasoning assumes that weather patterns have been consistent for the past 1000 years, when it's known that natural cycles can vary over time. furthermore, the argument does not take into account potential changes in data collection and analysis methods over the past several centuries, making it difficult to compare modern data with ancient data.",False
415,I drank bottled water and now I am sick. The water must have made me sick.,false causality,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

step 1: identify the argument being presented, which is that the bottled water caused the sickness.

step 2: notice that the term ""water"" is ambiguous in this context, as it could refer either to the liquid inside the bottle or to any type of water (such as tap water).

step 3: recognize that the argument assumes that the bottled water was the cause of sickness without considering other potential sources or causes.

step 4: understand that, since the argument is based on the assumption that ""water"" refers specifically to the bottled water consumed, it commits the fallacy of equivocation by using an ambiguous term in a way that misleads the reader or listener.",False
416,The purpose of this operation is to protect people who have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kiev regime.,false causality,"answer: guilt by association

1st expert: the statement implies that all members of a group (the kiev regime) are responsible for the actions of its individual members, which is an example of guilt by association.

2nd expert: furthermore, it does not specify which actions or policies of the kiev regime are considered humiliating and genocidal, making it difficult to evaluate the claim's accuracy.

3rd expert: moreover, the statement does not provide evidence to support the assertion that the kiev regime is responsible for these alleged atrocities.

4th expert (remaining): the argument assumes that all members of the group share collective guilt without providing any justification or proof, making it a clear case of guilt by association.",False
417,After the introduction of 5G technology there was a sudden increase in reported cases of COVID-19. 5G technology must be causing the virus.,false causality,"'answer: fallacy of correlation'

step 1 (expert 1): identified a possible relationship between two events (the introduction of 5g technology and the increase in reported covid-19 cases).

step 2 (expert 2): recognized that a single instance of correlation does not prove causation.

step 3 (expert 3): understood that there are several uncontrolled variables, such as seasonal changes or human behavior, which could also cause the increase in reported cases, undermining any potential causality between 5g technology and covid-19.",False
418,Vaccines cause autism - there was a rise in autism diagnoses following the release of a new vaccine.,false causality,"step 1: appeal to causation (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy)
reasoning: the correlation between the rise in autism diagnoses and the release of a new vaccine does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused the increase in autism cases. other factors could be at play, such as improved diagnostic techniques or changes in societal attitudes towards autism.

step 2: appeal to ignorance (also known as argumentum ad ignorantiam fallacy)
reasoning: the absence of evidence does not necessarily mean that a claim is false. more research and data analysis would be required to establish a causative link between vaccines and autism.

step 3: nothing (assuming all experts agree with the reasoning up to this point)
final answer: answer: nothing (if the previous steps lead to agreement among the experts that the statement is not a fallacy as described)",False
419,The occurrence of natural disasters coincides with military exercises or operations in certain regions. These disasters must be caused by covert military actions.,false causality,"answer: appeal to association (guilt by association fallacy)

1st expert: the occurrence and the military activities seem related, but no evidence is provided that the military actions cause these natural disasters.
2nd expert: the claim assumes that every correlation between two events implies causation, which is not logically valid.
3rd expert: however, it also infers that the military operations are responsible for the occurrence of natural disasters in those regions without providing any evidence or reason to support this assumption.",False
420,The presence of unusual weather patterns correlates with sightings of unidentified flying objects. These UFOs must be manipulating the weather.,false causality,"answer: appeal to correlation (or equivocation, depending on how one interprets ""manipulating the weather"")

step 1 (expert 1): the statement presents a correlation between unusual weather patterns and ufo sightings, but it does not provide any evidence that the ufos are causing or manipulating the weather.

step 2 (expert 2): however, if we assume that ""manipulating the weather"" means having control over it, there is no evidence provided for this claim either. the term ""weather patterns"" can also be interpreted as a more general term to describe any type of weather condition, not necessarily unusual ones, which may lead to equivocation fallacy.

step 3 (expert 3): since the statement does not provide evidence to support the conclusion that ufos are manipulating or controlling weather patterns, it falls under the appeal to correlation fallacy, unless we consider the argument as being based on a misinterpretation of the term ""manipulating."" in that case, equivocation fallacy may also be applicable.",False
421,After the introduction of genetically modified foods there was an increase in reported cases of cancer. GMOs must be causing cancer.,false causality,"initial thought: correlation does not imply causation (fallacy of causality)

second thought: no evidence provided that gmos are actually the cause of cancer, only a correlation between their introduction and cancer reports (no direct causal relationship established)

third thought: it is possible that other factors may be responsible for both the introduction of gmos and the increase in reported cases of cancer (confounding variables)

final answer: nothing (no fallacy identified, but the argument lacks evidence to support a causal link between gmos and cancer)",False
422,The discovery of ancient artifacts coincides with mysterious disappearances or accidents. Therefore these artifacts must be cursed or possessed.,false causality,"answer: appeal to causality (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc)
explanation step 1: the statement presents a correlation between the discovery of ancient artifacts and mysterious disappearances/accidents, but does not establish causation.
explanation step 2: the argument incorrectly infers that because these events occur at the same time, one must cause the other (possibly due to the artifacts being cursed or possessed).
explanation step 3: the missing evidence for a clear cause-effect relationship between the two events leads to an illogical conclusion.",False
423,"I would never hurt a puppy nor ask anyone else to. Pets are not used in animal testing. Again, would you save a diseased rat over yourself?",false dilemma,"answer: guilt by association fallacy

explanation: step 1 (first expert): the argument is based on the premise that since pets are not used in animal testing and i stated that i wouldn't hurt a puppy, therefore, i must be against any type of animal testing. however, this premise assumes that anyone who is against cruelty to animals would also be against using animals for scientific purposes, which might not always hold true.

step 2 (second expert): the argument is making an assumption that because i am against the idea of hurting pets and not using them in testing implies that i would choose a diseased rat over myself. this is an illogical leap as the situation presented does not reflect real-life scenarios or ethical dilemmas where self-preservation is crucial to survival.

step 3 (third expert): the argument uses guilt by association fallacy, as it associates my stated preference for pets with the broader issue of animal testing. this false connection is used to make an unwarranted assumption about my moral stance on this matter.",False
424,Testing on animals could save the life of you or a family member. Do you really think the life of your child is less important than a mouse?,false dilemma,answer: appeal to emotion,False
425,you’re either with us or against us,false dilemma,"step 1 (expert a): this statement seems to present only two options, and it implies that there is no middle ground. this can be classified as a false dichotomy fallacy because it oversimplifies the issue by limiting the options to two extremes when more options actually exist.

step 2 (expert b): the statement further implies that one must choose one of these two options, without acknowledging the possibility of people who don't believe in what is being debated. this can be seen as an example of guilt by association fallacy, since it assumes that those who don’t take a side are equivalent to those who are against it.

step 3 (expert c): the statement also seems to suggest that not taking a side implies agreement with the opposite view. this is an example of the appeal to fear fallacy because it uses fear as a motivator to get people to choose one side or the other, without providing evidence for the claim that there are only two options and that choosing the other side would lead to negative consequences.

answer: appeal to fear (guilt by association)",False
426,America: Love it or leave it.,false dilemma,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to patriotism)

expert 1: starts with a political statement about america and uses the term ""love"" which can be considered an emotional response.

expert 2: identifies that the statement is trying to influence one's stance towards america based on emotions rather than logical or rational reasons.

expert 3: recognizes that this emotional manipulation is a form of fallacy, specifically appeal to emotion.

final answer: answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to patriotism)",False
427,Death is nothing to fear. It is either annihilation or migration.,false dilemma,"initial thoughts: the statement presents two extremes (annihilation and migration) without providing evidence for either claim, and it implies that not fearing death means accepting one of these options as truth. this could be seen as an appeal to fear, where the statement attempts to downplay the fear of death by presenting it as an unproven possibility. however, there is no explicit attempt to motivate acceptance based on fear.

second thoughts: the statement does not provide any evidence or reasons for why death is either annihilation or migration, and it uses ambiguous terms such as ""migration"" without clearly defining what that means in this context. this could be seen as an equivocation fallacy, where the term ""migration"" has multiple meanings and its intended meaning here is unclear.

final answer: equivocation",False
428,Be my friend or be my enemy.,false dilemma,"the first expert would say: this statement appears to be an example of a dichotomy fallacy, as it presents only two extreme options and does not consider the possibility of other viewpoints or alternatives.

the second expert would say: the statement also seems to be an appeal to fear, using the potential of being labeled an enemy to manipulate someone into choosing the friend option.

the third expert would say: upon further examination, the statement may also be an example of circular reasoning, as choosing to be a friend implies that you are not an enemy, and vice versa.

upon discussion, all experts agree that the statement can be classified as circular reasoning due to its self-reinforcing nature, with the dichotomy fallacy and appeal to fear being secondary aspects of the statement.

answer: circular reasoning",False
429,Are you a Republican or a Democrat?,false dilemma,"answer: appeal to tradition.

explanation: step 1: the statement suggests that one must be either a republican or a democrat, implying that these are the two traditional political parties in the united states.
step 2: this argument assumes that because these parties have been historically prevalent, their continued use is justified and correct today.
step 3: the argument does not take into account the possibility of other political ideologies or the evolution of political party systems.
step 4: therefore, the reasoning uses the historical preference (tradition) as evidence that the traditional parties are the only acceptable options.",False
430,"If you're not going to heaven, you must be going to you-know-where.",false dilemma,"answer: appeal to fear.

first expert: the statement suggests that there are only two possible outcomes (heaven and you-know-where), and non-believers in god are assumed to go to the latter. this is an attempt to scare people into believing, rather than offering evidence or reason for why heaven exists or why not believing leads to the other place.

second expert: the assumption that non-believers automatically go to a specific place (you-know-where) is a premise without justification, as there are many people who do not believe in god but lead moral and ethical lives.

third expert: no further steps are needed because the reasoning of both previous experts leads us to the conclusion that this statement is an appeal to fear fallacy.",False
431,"Good students will study and learn without the threat of an exam, and bad students won't study and learn even with the threat of an exam. So, exams serve no purpose",false dilemma,"answer: fallacy of division

step 1 (expert 1): the argument infers that something is true of one or more of the parts from the fact that it is true of the whole.

step 2 (expert 2): here, the whole (students in general) is being used to make a conclusion about each individual student (good students and bad students). however, the size of the group does not necessarily dictate the behavior of every individual within that group.

step 3 (expert 3): since it's not shown that all good students won't study without an exam and all bad students will still study even with an exam, the conclusion that exams serve no purpose is unfounded due to the fallacy of division.",False
432,"Since there is nothing good on TV tonight, I will just have to get drunk.",false dilemma,"step 1: appeal to negative emotion (appeal to anger in this case)
step 2: the argument is trying to make the conclusion seem reasonable by appealing to a negative direction of emotion rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.
final answer: appeal to negative emotion",False
433,"Obviously great mathematicians are born, and not made. John had all the best opportunities and is only mediocre at math. But Kara was good at math from the beginning.",false dilemma,"step 1: appeal to tradition - the argument assumes that because someone was good at math from the beginning, they were ""born"" as a great mathematician, implying that this has always been the case and that there is no need for further education or opportunities.

step 2: circular reasoning - the argument concludes that john had all the best opportunities because he was only mediocre at math, while kara was good from the beginning and therefore must have been a great mathematician who did not need any additional opportunities. however, the initial premise is based on the conclusion that john did not need those opportunities because he is only mediocre.

step 3: nothing - both the appeal to tradition and circular reasoning have already been addressed by the previous experts, so there are no further steps to take in this case.

answer: circular reasoning",False
434,"On the quad, I see the jocks in one corner, the rebels in another, and the intellectual set in yet another. Which one of these groups do you hang out with?",false dilemma,"answer: appeal to tradition

step 1: the statement describes a scenario where people are placed in three distinct groups based on their characteristics (jocks, rebels, intellectual set).
step 2: the question asks which group the reader identifies with.
step 3: this question is using the historical preferences of these specific groups as evidence that the reader belongs to one of those groups. it implies that if a person hangs out in a certain location on the quad, they belong to that group by tradition.
step 4: tradition, in this case, is being used as evidence for the question's premise.

thus, the fallacy being committed here is appeal to tradition.",False
435,"You ask how I can know that you're struggling financially?  It's simple: in a capitalist economy, you either win big or you lose big, and I know you're not one of the big winners.",false dilemma,"answer: fallacy of division

explanation (step 1 - expert 1): the argument infers that something is true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole. here, the whole is a capitalist economy, and the part is a person's financial situation.

explanation (step 2 - expert 2): however, the size of the whole (capitalist economy) is not directly related to the size of every part of it (a single person's financial situation). the argument is an oversimplification and does not hold true in this case.

explanation (step 3 - expert 3): there are exceptions to the rule, as some people may be struggling financially even when they are considered ""big winners"" in the capitalist economy. therefore, the conclusion that the person in question is losing big because they aren't one of the big winners doesn't hold up.

explanation (final agreement): answer: fallacy of division",False
436,"If we don’t order pizza for dinner, we’ll have to eat the week-old spaghetti in the fridge.",false dilemma,"answer: appeal to fear

expert 1: this is an attempt to make a decision based on fear of the alternative option (eating week-old spaghetti), rather than making a logical or reasoned choice.

expert 2: the argument does not provide any evidence or justification for the claim that eating week-old spaghetti would be unacceptable, only stating it as a fearful alternative to ordering pizza.

expert 3: no further steps needed, the conclusion can be drawn based on the premises presented. the argument is using fear to manipulate the decision, and this qualifies as an appeal to fear fallacy.",False
437,"Use our fertilizer, or your crops will wither.",false dilemma,"step 1: appeal to fear
step 2: none (the statement does not provide reasons or evidence for the claim that the crops will wither)
step 3: circular reasoning (using the consequence of the proposition as the justification for it)
answer: appeal to fear, circular reasoning",False
438,5 out of 7 doctors recommend this medication over its direct competitor.,false dilemma,"'answer: appeal to false authority'

1st expert: this statement claims that 5 out of 7 doctors recommend the medication, which implies that these doctors are authoritative figures on the issue. however, it does not specify whether these doctors are actual medical professionals or if they have any specific expertise in this particular medication or its direct competitor.

2nd expert: since the statement only mentions a group of doctors without specifying their qualifications, it is an appeal to false authority, as the argument is using an unqualified source as evidence.

3rd expert: agreed. the fact that these doctors are supposedly 'recommending' this medication does not mean they have any special knowledge or expertise on the matter. this would be considered an appeal to false authority fallacy.",False
439,"If we want to make campus safer, we can either install more security cameras or ban visitors.",false dilemma,"step 1: binary choice presented between two options (install more security cameras or ban visitors)
step 2: no middle ground or alternative solutions suggested (no mention of increasing police presence, improving lighting, etc.)
step 3: the argument implies that one solution will automatically make the campus safer without considering potential downsides or unintended consequences (e.g., invasion of privacy with more cameras, limiting academic freedom by banning visitors)
step 4: no evidence provided to support the claim that either solution will actually make the campus safer
final answer: appeal to emotion (the argument attempts to manipulate emotions by making people feel scared and wanting a quick fix to the problem, without providing any evidence or reasoning for the proposed solutions.)",False
440,“You either support all government policies or you leave the country.”,false dilemma,"answer: appeal to extreme (or false dichotomy)

explanation step 1: the statement presents a binary choice, with no middle ground or nuance allowed. this is a fallacy known as a false dichotomy.

explanation step 2: however, it is not an absolute truth that one must support all government policies to remain in the country. people may disagree with certain policies but still have valid reasons for remaining in their home countries.

explanation step 3: therefore, the statement oversimplifies the situation and presents a false dichotomy, implying that there are only two options when in reality there are many more possible positions.",False
441,"Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.",false dilemma,answer: appeal to fear,False
442,I didnt watch the worldcup.  But he did a good job in the Bundesliga. Im sure he was the best.,hasty generalization,"initial thoughts: the statement suggests that the speaker is making an argument based on someone's performance in one context (bundesliga) and using it to argue that they are the best overall, which implies comparing their skills across different contexts without any evidence or justification.

first step: this could be considered a form of 'appeal to false authority'. the bundesliga might be a relevant context for evaluating the person's skill, but it does not make them the best in all contexts.

second step: however, the speaker does not claim that the bundesliga is an authoritative source on the person's overall abilities, so this argument does not fit strictly into the 'appeal to false authority' fallacy. instead, it might be a case of making a hasty generalization or overinterpreting limited evidence – in this case, performance within one context.

third step: upon further examination, we see that the statement is not explicitly claiming the person as the best in the world, but rather suggests that they could be among the top players. this implies a degree of uncertainty and speculation on behalf of the speaker, making it hard to categorize as a strict fallacy.

final answer: 'answer: nothing' (no clear example of a specific fallacy can be identified in this statement.)",True
443,"I do just think, that germany is fair. You got a health-insurance for everyone, even for celebs. Thats why legal system has to be fair, too.",hasty generalization,"step 1 (expert a): appeal to authority - the person is using the healthcare system in germany as evidence that the legal system should also be fair, but healthcare and law are not the same area of expertise.

step 2 (expert b): equivocation - the person is using ""fair"" ambiguously. in one context it means having health insurance, while in another it implies impartiality or justice within the legal system.

step 3 (expert c): fallacy of division - the person is making a generalization that since everyone in germany has health insurance, then the legal system should also be fair for everyone, which is not necessarily true.

answer: fallacy of division",False
444,"If I look at all these global organizations (OSN, NATO, EU commission), it just seems a global force is made for profit of only these guys sitting there. They do only care about themselves. Will then this new global force be different? I doubt so, this is the same sort of people.",hasty generalization,"step 1: appeal to negative emotion (appeal to anger)
step 2: guilt by association
step 3: circular reasoning
answer: appeal to anger and guilt by association",False
445,A friend of mine lives vegan. He got ill. Veganism is bad for everybody.,hasty generalization,"step 1 (expert 1): equivocation - the term ""vegan"" is being used ambiguously, as the argument conflates a diet with overall health.

step 2 (expert 2): fallacy of division - the ill health of one individual does not imply that veganism is bad for everyone.

step 3 (expert 3): nothing - no other fallacies have been identified in the statement, as it doesn't make an argument or conclusion based on evidence or reason. however, it does contain a misleading implication that could be considered a logical fallacy if taken as an argument for veganism being bad for everybody.

answer: nothing (but note the implied fallacious reasoning in the statement)",False
446,Inception did not get 11 Oscars. So Titanic shouldnt get 11 oscars as well. Both movies had Leonardo di Caprio as main-actor.,hasty generalization,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

explanation step 1: the premise assumes that because inception and titanic share the common factor of leonardo di caprio as the main actor, they are equivalent in all aspects, including the number of oscars they should receive.
explanation step 2: this is an equivocation fallacy because the term ""equivalent"" is being used ambiguously to mean both similar in terms of having leonardo di caprio as the main actor and similar in terms of receiving the same number of oscars, when it should only be applied to the former.
explanation step 3: the reasoning here ignores other factors that determine oscar nominations such as screenplay, direction, cinematography, etc., which are not shared by inception and titanic.",False
447,"School detention is great, it was good for me. I did never do homework, thats why my teacher forced me to detention. My grades went up from 3,5 to 2.",hasty generalization,"answer: appeal to personal anecdote

expert 1: this argument relies on the speaker's personal experience and assumes that it applies universally, which is a fallacy.

expert 2: the claim does not provide evidence or data to prove that school detention has a positive effect for everyone, making it an appeal to personal anecdote.

expert 3: there is no justification or reasoning provided in the argument to support that all students will benefit from school detention, as it depends on individual circumstances.",False
448,I helped at a refugee-welcome-station. I didnt see a refugee commit crimes. I think no refugee committed crimes until cologne.,hasty generalization,"answer: appeal to fear

expert 1: this statement implies that because one has not seen a refugee committing a crime, it means no refugees have committed any crimes until the event in cologne. this is an oversimplification and generalization based on personal experience rather than evidence or reason.

expert 2: the argument tries to instill fear that refugees might commit crimes, using a specific event as proof that this fear is valid. however, the fear is unjustified, as it is based on an assumption that the behavior of one refugee represents all refugees.

expert 3: the statement attempts to frighten people into accepting the conclusion that refugees are dangerous due to the potential for crime, even though there is no evidence or reason provided to support this claim. this is known as appeal to fear.",False
449,School detention in high school means more school and less freetime. Less freetime lead to severe psychological problems for a schoolmate of mine. Therefore it does not do any good.,hasty generalization,"answer: fallacy of division
explanation (expert 1): the argument infers that something is true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole. however, not all students in detention experience severe psychological problems.
explanation (expert 2): even if less freetime does lead to severe psychological problems for a particular student, it does not mean that detention as a whole leads to such problems for every student.
explanation (final expert): the conclusion is drawn based on the experience of one individual, which is not representative of all individuals in detention, thus committing the fallacy of division.",False
450,"A global task force to stop Ebola solved the issue, so this environment task force will do its job, too.",hasty generalization,"answer: appeal to false authority

explanation: the reasoning behind this is that the argument assumes the expertise of a group (global task force to stop ebola) in one area (ebola) can be directly applied to another unrelated area (environment). this assumption is fallacious as the expertise required for solving ebola might not necessarily translate to environmental issues.",False
451,Christiano Ronaldo played so bad in 2014. He cannot be the best in 2016.,hasty generalization,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the argument states that because someone had a poor performance in the past, they cannot have a better performance in the future. this is based on the assumption that a person's skill level doesn't change over time.

expert 2: if the ability of a person does not change, then it wouldn't make sense to claim that someone who was previously considered great, could no longer be great in the future. the argument assumes the conclusion in its premise.

expert 3: the reasoning in the statement is circular as it relies on the assumption that a player's performance does not change over time, and uses that same assumption to support the conclusion that the player cannot be great in the future.",False
452,My sister is only watching TV and talks less than earlier. TV is bad for communication among family-members.,hasty generalization,"the first expert might say: this seems like an example of a fallacy known as 'causal oversimplification', as the argument assumes that tv directly causes reduced communication, without considering other factors.

the second expert might say: however, even if we assume that tv does impact communication, it's not necessarily bad for family-communication. it could be a form of relaxation or bonding for some families. so, let's rephrase the argument to avoid oversimplification.

the third expert might say: in this revised argument, the claim that 'tv is bad for communication among family-members' seems to be based on an assumption, not factual evidence. this could be an example of 'unsubstantiated assumption'.

the final answer would be: answer: unsubstantiated assumption",False
453,"My son has developed anxiety because of the continuous grading. It is bad for all students in high school,  too much pressure...",hasty generalization,"step 1: appeal to fear
step 2: appeal to emotion (in this case, appeal to pity)
final answer: appeal to pity",False
454,Its beneficial for handicapped children to study with healthy ones. So its also the other way round.,hasty generalization,"step 1: appeal to symmetry (also known as argumentum ad symmetricam)
explanation: the argument assumes that because it's beneficial for handicapped children to study with healthy ones, it must be equally beneficial for healthy children to study with handicapped ones. however, this is not necessarily true as the circumstances and needs of both groups might not be symmetrical.

step 2: nothing (since all experts agree on the fallacy classification)
explanation: the argument does not fall into any of the previously defined fallacies. it is a flawed argument due to assuming symmetry, but it does not use fear, false authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, appeal to anger, straw man, appeal to tradition, equivocation, division, tu quoque, appeal to positive emotion, or appeal to pity.",False
455,I dont know a healthy person that wants to suicide. No healthy person wants this.,hasty generalization,"answer: appeal to majority (or appeal to ignorance)

1st expert: this statement assumes that being healthy and wanting to commit suicide are mutually exclusive. it implies that if someone is healthy, they cannot want to commit suicide, but it doesn't provide any evidence to support that claim.

2nd expert: the argument also makes a generalization based on the experience of one or more individuals, implying that all healthy people share the same desires and thoughts regarding suicidal ideation. however, it does not account for the possibility that some healthy individuals may have suicidal thoughts, which contradicts the claim made in the statement.

3rd expert: the argument ignores the reality that mental health issues can exist regardless of physical health status. a person with good physical health could still struggle with mental health problems that lead to suicidal ideation.

answer: appeal to ignorance (or appeal to majority)",False
456,"No, because if one company sends jobs to developing countries, then they all will.",hasty generalization,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: the argument infers that because one company does something (sends jobs), all companies will do the same thing. however, this is not necessarily true since each company may have different policies and business strategies.

expert 2: the argument assumes that a single action by one company will cause an identical reaction from all other companies in the same industry. this is not based on evidence or reasoning.

expert 3: the conclusion relies on the premise that similar actions by one company will lead to similar actions by all others, without any justification for this assumption. the argument is therefore fallacious due to the fallacy of division.",False
457,"Past years and data have shown us that non-Europeans who have immigrated to Europe do not often cause issues and some even boost the economy. Therefore, all non-Europeans can and will boost European economy and preserve the integrity of European countries.",hasty generalization,"answer: appeal to tradition

expert 1: the claim is based on past events (past years and data have shown us that non-europeans who have immigrated to europe do not often cause issues and some even boost the economy).

expert 2: however, it generalizes all non-europeans to a single group with identical characteristics (therefore, all non-europeans can and will boost european economy...). this is assuming that everyone from any particular ethnicity or nationality will behave in the same way, which may not be true.

expert 3: additionally, it asserts that all non-europeans will preserve the integrity of european countries. this implies that european culture and values are so fragile that they can only be maintained by europeans themselves, which is a fallacious assumption.",False
458,I dont care. Since the attacks from cologne i know how what refugees are: Criminals. And criminals dont belong here. Send them all back!,hasty generalization,"analysis 1: appeal to fear. the argument uses the fear of crime as a primary motivator without providing evidence or reason.

analysis 2: guilt by association. the argument associates refugees with criminal behavior without considering individual cases or contexts.

analysis 3: circular reasoning. the argument assumes that all refugees are criminals and then uses this assumption to argue that they should be sent back.

final answer: circular reasoning",False
459,Temelin exploded. It is never ok to use it.,hasty generalization,"step 1: appeal to emotion (specifically, anger)
step 2: temelin's emotional outburst does not provide any evidence or reasoning, therefore the statement can be classified as 'nothing' (no fallacy detected).",False

461,There do exist local environment task forces. They all do a good job. Therefore a global environment task force has to be good as well.,hasty generalization,answer: fallacy of division,False
462,I watched Reservoir Dogs. The movie was too violent for me. Im sure his movies are all too violent.,hasty generalization,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement is an example of the straw man fallacy because the person has misrepresented the argument by implying that all of quentin tarantino's films are excessively violent when they may not be.

step 2 (expert 2): the individual has used circular reasoning to justify their conclusion, as their personal reaction to one movie is being used as evidence for the generalizability of that reaction to all of the filmmaker's work.

step 3 (expert 3): the arguer has employed the fallacy of division by assuming a single characteristic of one work can be applied to an entire oeuvre without sufficient basis.

answer: fallacy of division",False
463,"Some people need plastic surgery after horrific accidents. Therefore, all forms of plastic surgery are good and plastic surgery is an important field of medicine.",hasty generalization,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation step 1: the conclusion is that ""plastic surgery is an important field of medicine"" but the premise is also that it's important because ""all forms of plastic surgery are good"".
explanation step 2: this is circular reasoning, as the premise relies on the conclusion to support itself.
explanation step 3: the experts would agree that this is a fallacy of circular reasoning.",False
464,I’ve met two people in Greece so far and they were both nice to me. So all the people I will meet in Greece will be nice to me.,hasty generalization,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: this argument infers that something is true of one or more of the parts from the fact that it is true of the whole. the ""parts"" being individual people, and the ""whole"" being the population of greece.

expert 2: the size of the sample (two people) is not nearly representative of the entire population of greece.

expert 3: it's possible that those two people were just unusually nice or were intentionally kind to a stranger, and this does not guarantee that all other greeks will be equally friendly.",False
465,"Facebook cost me just time, a lot of time! It is bad for all others as well and bad for society.",hasty generalization,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to negative emotion)

expert 1: the statement seems to be based on the emotion of frustration or annoyance with facebook rather than factual evidence or reasoning about its impact on others and society.

expert 2: the arguer's personal feelings towards facebook are being used as the primary motivation to support the conclusion that it is bad for all others and bad for society, without any justification based on evidence or reason.

expert 3: there is no evidence or reason provided in the statement for why facebook is necessarily ""bad"" for other people or society, only the arguer's emotional reaction to their personal experience with it. therefore, this can be classified as an appeal to negative emotion fallacy.",False
466,At the birthday I attended over the weekend there was a clown. Clowns are a part of birthday parties.,hasty generalization,"answer: equivocation

step 1 (expert 1): the term ""clown"" is ambiguous, as it can refer to both an entertainer or an actual animal in this context.

step 2 (expert 2): the sentence infers that the presence of a clown (the entertainer) at a birthday party is evidence that there was an actual animal clown present.

step 3 (expert 3): the fact that a clown (entertainer) was at a birthday doesn't imply the presence of an animal clown, thus making an argument misleading and falling under equivocation fallacy.",False
467,"Turkey helped us with the Refugees. They were beneficial for the EU there, they will be beneficial for the EU in general.",hasty generalization,"initial thoughts: the argument seems to be making a causal connection between a specific instance (help provided to refugees) and a broader claim (beneficial for the eu in general).

step 1: possible fallacy classification - appeal to cause or effect fallacy. this fallacy occurs when someone assumes that just because one specific event happened, it will always happen again in similar situations, without any evidence to support this assumption.

step 2: considering the context and structure of the argument, we could also classify it as an appeal to analogy, which is a more specific type of fallacy where a comparison is made between two things that are not truly comparable due to differences in essential characteristics or circumstances.

final answer: appeal to cause or effect (or appeal to analogy)",False
468,Uli Hoeneß went to jail. Therefore celebreties are treated the same way as non-celebrities.,hasty generalization,"answer: equivocation

1. uli hoeneß is a celebrity (in some context).
2. being a celebrity does not mean being equal to a common citizen in legal terms.
3. the claim that celebrities are treated the same way as non-celebritries in jail is an oversimplification and incorrect assumption, which is the essence of equivocation fallacy.",False
469,"Sorry, but your teacher has no idea. When i was in Frankfurt some weeks ago, i met a drug-addict. He was so nice to me, it wasnt a problem at all. So we dont need heavier penalties.",hasty generalization,"answer: appeal to anecdote

expert 1: the argument uses the experience of a single individual (a drug addict) as evidence that more severe penalties are not needed. this is a fallacy because one person's personal experience does not necessarily reflect the general truth or trend about the issue at hand.

expert 2: the statement does not present any statistical data, research, or analysis to support the conclusion that heavier penalties are unnecessary. instead, it relies on the emotional appeal of a positive interaction with one person.

expert 3: since there is no evidence provided to back up the claim that lighter penalties should be applied due to this encounter, and the argument does not consider any potential negative consequences of drug abuse, we can classify it as an appeal to anecdote fallacy.",False
470,I always wait until the last minute to complete my assignments and I’m still passing all my classes. There’s nothing wrong with procrastinating and putting off your assignments.,hasty generalization,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to anecdotal evidence - the claim is based on a single case or example, but it doesn't provide generalizable evidence for the assertion that procrastination isn't problematic.

step 2 (expert 2): false cause fallacy - the conclusion drawn about procrastinating not being wrong does not necessarily follow from the fact of passing classes. passing grades can be influenced by many factors, not just the method of completing assignments.

step 3 (expert 3): fallacy of undistributed middle - the argument assumes that because one person can procrastinate and still pass, it implies that procrastination is a viable strategy for everyone. this overlooks the possibility that individual circumstances may influence this relationship.

answer: fallacy of undistributed middle",False
471,"I knew this one guy who had plastic surgery to reconstruct his ear after an accident, and it was a huge success. It was good for him, so it is an important field of medicine.",hasty generalization,"answer: appeal to anecdote

expert 1: this is a case study about one person's experience with plastic surgery for ear reconstruction.
expert 2: however, this does not provide evidence that plastic surgery for ear reconstruction is generally successful or important in all cases.
expert 3: the argument fails to consider the many factors that may influence the success of such surgeries on a case-by-case basis.",False
472,"Yes, whoever drinks and drives has a bad reaction time. People might die.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of 'appeal to fear' as the argument is trying to use the fear of people dying as a primary motivator for accepting the conclusion without providing evidence or reason.
step 2 (expert 2): the statement also shows some elements of 'circular reasoning', as the conclusion that 'whoever drinks and drives has a bad reaction time' is based on the premise that 'people might die'.
step 3 (expert 3): however, the argument does not rely solely on circular reasoning because it provides a reason for the poor reaction time: drinking. therefore, we should revise our classification as: answer: appeal to fear and circular reasoning.",False
473,Of course same-sex marriage should be allowed.,nothing,"initial thought: this statement seems to challenge the appeal to tradition fallacy, as it questions the historical preference (traditional definition of marriage being between a man and a woman) and advocates for change.

next thought: however, if someone were to argue against this statement by saying ""marriage has been traditionally defined as between a man and a woman; therefore, same-sex marriage should not be allowed,"" then we could say that this is an appeal to tradition fallacy because they are using historical preferences as evidence for why something should or should not be allowed today.

final answer: answer: appeal to tradition (if the argument against same-sex marriage uses historical preferences as evidence).",False
474,We shouldn't allow men to oppress women.,nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion

step 1: the statement appeals to an emotion, specifically anger or disgust towards men who oppress women. this is because the statement implies that it is inherently wrong for men to oppress women, which can be interpreted as a call to action based on emotional response rather than rational argumentation.

step 2: the statement does not provide evidence or reasoning that supports the claim that allowing men to oppress women is inherently wrong. instead, it relies solely on an emotional appeal for action against this supposed injustice.

step 3: while there may be some truth to the idea that allowing men to oppress women is morally unacceptable, this is not demonstrated through reason or evidence in the statement. rather, the statement attempts to manipulate emotions by suggesting that one should feel angry about this issue. therefore, it can be classified as an appeal to emotion fallacy.

step 4: all experts agree with this classification of the fallacy as 'appeal to emotion'. no further steps are needed as the final agreement has been reached.",False
475,Good point. Why not.,nothing,"the first expert might say: ""i see an appeal to tradition here, as the argument is based on historical preferences regarding marriage.""

the second expert might say: ""i agree with the first expert that it is an appeal to tradition, but i would also like to add that it is a fallacy of division, as the truth of one part (historical preference) does not necessarily apply to the whole (today's societal norms).""

the third expert might say: ""i agree with both experts. i would like to point out that it is also equivocation, as the term 'marriage' has more than one sense (traditional vs. modern), and this ambiguity confuses the argument.""

answer: appeal to tradition, fallacy of division, equivocation",False
476,Just a test argument.,nothing,"statement: i don’t believe we should support the new policy because if it passes, the economy will collapse.

step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be using fear as the primary motivator to accept the conclusion. this is an example of 'appeal to fear'.

step 2 (expert 2): the claim that the policy passing would cause the economy to collapse lacks justification or evidence. this supports the first expert's classification as 'appeal to fear'.

step 3 (expert 3): however, it is not clear if the argument is based on a premise without evidence, so i need more context to determine if this is an actual case of 'appeal to fear'. let us assume that there was no supporting evidence provided for the claim.

final answer: 'answer: appeal to fear'",False
477,"Yes, they do make schools more effective.",nothing,"answer: appeal to positive emotion

expert 1: the statement suggests that schools will be made more effective by using a positive emotion (making people happy). however, this does not provide any evidence or reason for the claim.

expert 2: there is no mention of facts, data, or evidence regarding how schools are made more effective through happiness. instead, the argument relies on an emotional appeal rather than concrete evidence.

answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
478,Better testing new medical products on animals than on humans.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to tradition (the argument relies on historical practices, in this case using animals for testing instead of humans, as evidence that the practice is correct.)

step 2: none (no further steps needed, as the initial step has identified a fallacy based on the reasoning provided.)

answer: appeal to tradition",False
479,We as the country cannot afford that.,nothing,"answer: appeal to fear

step 1 (expert a): the statement implies a negative consequence if a certain action is not taken, which creates an atmosphere of fear and anxiety in the reader/listener. this is the definition of an appeal to fear fallacy.

step 2 (expert b): however, the claim that the country cannot afford a particular action lacks evidence or justification. it is based solely on the fear of potential negative consequences, which makes it problematic and fallacious.

step 3 (expert c): the statement does not provide any concrete information or substantiation to support the assertion that the country cannot afford that specific action. this lack of supporting evidence further reinforces that the statement is an appeal to fear fallacy.",False
480,"Yes, the Islamic state is becoming too big to fight without military operations.",nothing,"step 1: identifying the argument structure (initial expert)
the statement presents a conclusion (""military operations are needed"") based on a premise (""the islamic state is becoming too big"").

step 2: identifying potential fallacies (second expert)
in this case, the argument does not seem to rely on emotions or questionable sources of authority; therefore, we can eliminate appeal to anger, appeal to (false) authority, and guilt by association as possibilities.

step 3: assessing circular reasoning (third expert)
the conclusion seems to follow logically from the premise without any internal contradiction; thus, there is no clear instance of circular reasoning.

step 4: determining other fallacies (all experts)
the argument appears to present a problem and propose a solution in response, but it does not explicitly compare the scenario to worse problems or make use of straw man arguments.

step 5: reviewing the appeal to fear (all experts)
there is no obvious attempt to manipulate the audience with fear in this statement. while military operations can be associated with fear, there is no overt mention of fear as a motivator for accepting the conclusion.

step 6: reaching consensus (all experts)
the argument does not exhibit any fallacies that have been identified so far. therefore, the final answer is 'answer: nothing'.",True
481,Yes they allow us to connect.,nothing,"the experts start by individually analyzing the statement:

expert 1: this seems like an example of circular reasoning, as the conclusion is based on the premise itself without any external evidence. (circular reasoning)

expert 2: however, the statement mentions ""allowed"" and ""us"", suggesting that it's discussing permissions or rights granted to a group. it's not justifying an idea or conclusion, but rather describing a condition. (nothing - no fallacy in this particular example)

expert 1: upon re-examining the statement, you are right, it does not seem like a fallacy since it describes a situation without making any argumentative claims. (nothing - no fallacy in this particular example)

the final answer is 'answer: nothing'.",True
482,I don't think school uniforms can influence the pupils' performance.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be making a causal claim, stating that uniforms can or cannot affect pupil's performance. however, it does not provide any supporting evidence for this claim.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement also lacks a comparison or contrast between schools with and without uniform policies. without such comparison, it is difficult to establish a correlation between uniforms and academic performance.

step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, the statement does not account for other factors that could potentially influence pupil's performance, such as teaching quality, resources, student support services, etc. these omitted factors might be more influential than school uniform policies.

final answer: the statement presents an argument without proper evidence or comparison, thus it is a form of 'appeal to ignorance'.",False
483,"Yes, if the scientific progress stays the same as the last 200 years.",nothing,"initial thought: appeal to tradition (as it assumes that the rate of scientific progress should remain constant in the future based on its past)

second thought: fallacy of division (since the assumption is that because the rate has been consistent in the past, it will continue to be so in the future, which may not hold true)

third thought: nothing (as the argument does not rely on fear, false authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, appeal to anger, straw man fallacy, equivocation, or tu quoque)

final answer: fallacy of division",True
484,"Yes, the man has been on the moon.",nothing,"step 1: the statement is a claim about a historical event.
step 2: it is not presented as an argument or supported by evidence.
step 3: therefore, it cannot be classified as any of the fallacies described above.
answer: nothing",True
485,I don't think school uniforms can influence the pupils' performance.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement could be considered an example of a straw man fallacy, as the argument seems to oversimplify the issue by claiming that school uniforms have no effect on pupil's performance without acknowledging potential complexities or nuances in the relationship between the two.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it could also be seen as a logical conclusion based on insufficient evidence, since there might not yet be concrete proof that school uniforms can positively impact pupil's performance. this would make it neither a fallacy nor an example of a specific fallacy.

step 3 (expert 3): upon further reflection, we have to agree with expert 2 that the statement does not represent a specific fallacy in logic. it could simply be a genuine claim based on the currently available evidence, even though more research may be needed to determine the relationship between school uniforms and pupil's performance.

answer: nothing",True
486,"Yes, the man has been on the moon.",nothing,"step 1 (expert a): this statement is not a fallacy because it is making a claim about reality, which can be verified or falsified by evidence.
step 2 (expert b): however, if someone were to argue that we should never go back to the moon because neil armstrong's moon landing was a hoax, that would be an example of 'appeal to fear'. the argument is being based on unfounded fear (that the moon landing was faked) rather than evidence.
step 3 (expert c): if someone were to argue that we should never go back to the moon because armstrong's testimony alone is enough proof, that would be an example of 'appeal to authority'. the argument is relying on a single person's word as evidence, without any further supporting data.
answer: nothing (since the original statement itself does not contain a fallacy)",True
487,Children should go to regular schools.,nothing,"step 1 (expert a): the argument is not based on evidence or reason, but rather a general statement about children and education. this could potentially be an example of an appeal to tradition.

step 2 (expert b): however, the argument does not necessarily rely on historical preferences of people or specific individuals; it is more of a contemporary preference or policy. therefore, it might be better classified as 'nothing', as it does not fit neatly into any of the defined fallacies in this list.

step 3 (expert c): on further consideration, the argument could be seen as an appeal to authority if it is being suggested that regular schools are beneficial for children due to their widespread use or acceptance by society, which implies that they have been deemed authoritative or effective by a collective consensus. however, as we have already pointed out, the argument does not necessarily fit this definition either.

answer: nothing (or 'no clear fallacy' if you prefer)",True
488,"I own a computer-factory. And I'm outsourcing my support-callcenter to India. I don't want those people to work like animals. I pay less money than in Germany, yes, but it is still a lot of money for the workers there.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion

expert 1: the statement appeals to an emotional response rather than presenting logical arguments or evidence to support the claim that the workers in india are being treated well and paid a fair wage.

expert 2: however, it is important to note that the owner does state that they pay 'a lot of money' for the workers in india, which implies some form of compensation. the emotional appeal here is used to justify this claim, but further evidence or reasoning is still needed to support whether or not the wages are fair.

expert 3: there is no clear indication that the owner has compared the wages they pay in india with those paid in germany for similar work, and there is also no mention of working conditions or benefits provided to the workers. the emotional appeal is used as a substitute for actual evidence or reasoning in this argument.",False
489,"Yes, because he's blocked more shots than any other keeper.",nothing,answer: appeal to authority (the expert is not an authority on goalkeeping statistics),False
490,I don't like Heavy Metal generally.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to tradition
step 2: fallacy of division (assuming that liking a specific genre means disliking all other genres)
step 3: nothing (no further reasoning needed)
answer: appeal to tradition and fallacy of division",True
491,"As long as they take the precautions and responsibilities, it is the householders who should decide together whether to smoke inside or not.",nothing,"initial thoughts: the statement seems to suggest that the individuals living in a house have the right to decide whether or not to allow smoking indoors, provided they take certain precautions.

first step: this argument does not appear to fall under any of the previously defined fallacies as it presents a logical position based on responsibility and collective decision-making within the household.

second step: upon further analysis, there is no fear, false authority, appeal to worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, or anger being used in this argument. the statement also does not use straw man arguments, traditional values, equivocation, fallacy of division, tu quoque, appeal to positive emotion, or appeal to pity.

third step: since the statement is based on a reasonable and logical position, it can be concluded that there are no fallacies present in this argument.

final answer: answer: nothing",True
492,We might not want to home school all children because it is important for them to learn how to interact with others.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to tradition
step 2: circular reasoning
final answer: nothing (the statement does not contain a fallacy as described)",True
493,I do not think so because there is always the danger that the normal child might bully the handicapped one because of their mental weakness.,nothing,"this statement seems to be using a fallacy called ""appeal to fear"". the reasoning goes as follows:

1. expert 1: this statement is trying to scare or evoke fear about the possibility of a normal child bullying a handicapped one.
2. expert 2: however, this fear is not based on evidence or reason, it is being used as the primary motivator to accept the idea that the normal child might bully the handicapped one.
3. expert 3: therefore, the statement uses fear, not based on evidence or reason, as the primary motivator to get others to accept an idea (that a normal child might bully a handicapped one), which is fallacious.

answer: appeal to fear",False
494,I regard single-sex education as bad.,nothing,"answer: guilt by association

explanation step 1: the arguer is associating the negative concept of ""single-sex education being bad"" with a specific group (people who advocate for single-sex education).
explanation step 2: however, the mere advocacy for single-sex education does not make one a bad person.
explanation step 3: the arguer is assuming that those who support single-sex education are identical in other ways unrelated to their position on this issue, which is incorrect.",False
495,I think society in general benefits from social networks.,nothing,"step 1: initial thought - the statement does not explicitly use fear, anger, tradition, or authority to persuade, and it doesn't present a distorted version of the position (straw man). it also does not appeal to pity or positive emotion.

step 2: identify potential fallacies - no explicit use of circular reasoning, equivocation, appeal to worse problems, or guilt by association.

step 3: consider fallacy of division - the statement does not make a claim about parts of society based on the whole.

step 4: conclusion - since no fallacy has been identified, the answer is: 'answer: nothing'.",True
496,"For first steps in basic research, animal testing for medical reasons is more efficient than human testing.",nothing,"first expert: this argument appears to be an example of 'appeal to fear' fallacy because it presents the idea that the use of animals for testing is more efficient and thus less harmful, implying a dire consequence (loss of human lives) if human testing were to occur. however, this assumption is not justified without evidence or reason.

second expert: the argument also seems to be using 'appeal to tradition' fallacy as it suggests that animal testing has been done in the past and thus should continue because of its historical precedent.

third expert: i agree with the first two experts. i would like to add that this argument might be an example of 'circular reasoning' fallacy if the efficiency of animal testing is used as evidence for it being more efficient without considering other factors such as ethical implications, accuracy, and validity.

final answer: answer: circular reasoning (with possible contributions from appeal to fear and appeal to tradition)",False
497,"Yes, human beings have hunted and eaten animals for as long as can be shown and they are partly to blame for certain animal extinctions.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

step 1 - first expert: the phrase ""as long as can be shown"" is ambiguous, suggesting both a historical duration and an extent that can be demonstrated or proven.

step 2 - second expert: the phrase ""partly to blame"" implies some level of causation, but without clear evidence or specific details provided, it is unfounded.

step 3 - third expert: by combining the observations made by the previous experts, it becomes clear that the statement equivocates between historical duration and demonstrable proof, making it a fallacy of equivocation.",False
498,It's irresponsible to drive under the influence of alcohol.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems like an argument based on logical reasoning and evidence, not a fallacy.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it could be considered as an appeal to fear if the argument is being used to scare people into not driving under the influence of alcohol rather than providing them with actual facts or evidence about the dangers.

step 3 (expert 3): if the argument does not provide any facts or evidence about the dangers, then it indeed can be considered as an appeal to fear fallacy.

answer: appeal to fear",False
499,The information in social networks is often not reliable.,nothing,"initial step by expert 1: the statement seems to be making a claim about the reliability of information on social networks without providing any evidence or reasons for this claim, which could potentially fall under the category of appeal to fear or circular reasoning if the premise is that all information on social networks is unreliable because it comes from an unreliable source.

step by expert 2: however, it does not explicitly use fear as a primary motivator and there's no clear circular reasoning structure present, so it doesn't seem to fit the definitions of either appeal to fear or circular reasoning.

final step by expert 3: the statement is more likely an example of a generalization (or possibly an argument from authority) without sufficient evidence or reasons provided to support its claim about the reliability of information on social networks.

answer: generalization (or argument from authority, depending on the interpretation)",False
500,"I am a mother of 3 children and my body is not perfect anymore. But I don't care, because all people are pretty, no matter what their body looks like.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): the statement seems to be an appeal to emotion. the emotional state of the speaker (not caring about her own appearance) is used as a justification for a conclusion (all people are pretty).

step 2 (expert 2): however, it doesn't appear to be an appeal to anger or fear, as no negative emotions are expressed.

step 3 (expert 1): also, the statement does not seem to be circular reasoning since the conclusion is not reliant on its premise for justification.

step 4 (expert 2): the statement does not seem to use guilt by association or appeal to a false authority.

step 5 (expert 1): it also doesn't seem to use straw man fallacy as the speaker is presenting their own opinion about beauty, rather than misrepresenting someone else's argument.

step 6 (expert 2): the statement does not seem to appeal to tradition since there is no mention of historical preferences or norms.

step 7 (expert 1): equivocation seems unlikely as the term ""pretty"" is used consistently throughout the sentence without any ambiguity.

step 8 (expert 2): the fallacy of division does not seem applicable since the statement doesn't make a claim about specific parts of people based on a whole group or entity.

step 9 (expert 1): tu quoque is also not relevant, as the speaker isn't criticizing others for something they do themselves.

step 10 (expert 2): the appeal to positive emotion seems present since the speaker aims to create a positive emotional response (acceptance and appreciation of all bodies) in her audience.

answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
501,Neuer was the best goalkeeper of the World Cup in 2014 because he made the most saves.,nothing,"step 1: fallacy of division
the claim that neuer was the best goalkeeper of the world cup in 2014 based on the number of saves he made is a fallacy of division, as it infers that something true of one part (most saves) means it must be true of the whole (best goalkeeper). the quality of a goalkeeper encompasses more than just the number of saves they make.

step 2:
the number of saves made by a goalkeeper does not necessarily correlate with their overall skill or performance, as other factors such as positioning, decision-making, and reflexes also play important roles in determining the quality of a goalkeeper. therefore, it is incorrect to conclude that neuer was the best goalkeeper based solely on the number of saves he made.

step 3:
the final agreement between the experts would be 'answer: fallacy of division'. this conclusion is reached by understanding that the claim is making an inference from a part (saves) to the whole (best goalkeeper), which violates the logic of the fallacy of division.",False
502,"Yes. Although many forms of plastic surgery can be used for superficial reasons, it is important because it is also used to reconstruct things for people after bad accidents, or for gender reassignment, skin grafts from burns, etc.",nothing,"answer: appeal to good intentions

step 1 - expert a: argument focuses on the positive outcomes of plastic surgery, rather than providing evidence for its importance.

step 2 - expert b: however, it is important to acknowledge that plastic surgery does have beneficial applications beyond superficial reasons.

step 3 - expert c: the argument still fails to justify the importance of plastic surgery by relying on the positive outcomes without providing substantial evidence or reasoning for its relevance.",False
503,"He has made an important mark in the rap industry, but he did not live long enough to be the most influential rapper of all time.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

1st expert: the argument is based on the premise that the person was not the most influential rapper of all time, and this very premise is being used as evidence for the conclusion that he did not live long enough to be the most influential.

2nd expert: the argument assumes that being influential in the rap industry is solely dependent on how long one lives, which is an unfounded assumption.

3rd expert: no further steps necessary, all experts agree that this fallacy can be classified as circular reasoning.",False
504,There are advantages to sending your child to a co-ed school.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of 'appeal to tradition' fallacy, as it suggests that because something has been done in the past (sending children to co-ed schools), it is correct or beneficial today.

step 2 (expert 2): however, the statement does not explicitly state that sending children to co-ed schools has always been the tradition. the use of the phrase ""co-ed"" implies that this is a relatively modern practice, so the argument cannot rely on tradition in this case.

step 3 (expert 3): upon further consideration, it seems that the statement does not contain any other fallacies as described above. therefore, the answer is 'answer: nothing'.",True
505,It is not as effective as it could be. Many students can suffer due to ineffective policies.,nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)

expert 1: the argument seems to be more about trying to make the reader feel good, rather than providing a logical or factual basis for their claim.
expert 2: agreed, the focus seems to be on creating a positive emotional response in the reader, instead of presenting evidence or reasoning to support their point.
expert 3: i concur, the use of 'you will be happy' is intended to manipulate emotions in order to make the argument seem reasonable. the argument lacks substance and evidence for its conclusion.",False
506,Communication between family members suffers from watching TV.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to cause/effect fallacy (also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc) - the statement suggests that simply because two things occur at the same time, one must be causing the other without any evidence or reason provided to support this claim.

step 2: fallacy of causation - this fallacy occurs when a correlation between two events is assumed to imply a cause-and-effect relationship, without any further evidence or logical reasoning to support that assumption.

step 3: nothing - no additional steps are needed to confirm the conclusion as both appeal to cause/effect and fallacy of causation cover the reasoning presented in the statement.

answer: fallacy of causation",True
507,Nuclear power is necessary.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): initial assessment of argument structure.
step 2 (expert 2): identifying potential fallacies within the argument.
step 3 (expert 1): comparing the identified potential fallacy with the definitions provided.
step 4 (expert 2): confirming that the selected potential fallacy fits the definition provided.
step 5 (expert 1): determining whether any other potential fallacies exist within the argument.
step 6 (expert 2): verifying that no other fallacies were identified and considering the final answer.

answer: nothing (no fallacy was found in the provided statement; the claim about nuclear power being necessary is not a fallacy in itself but could potentially be supported or refuted by evidence and reasoning.)",True
508,Gorillas should live freely in nature.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion)
step 2: no new information provided, no justification for the claim that gorillas should live freely in nature.

509,Endless growth is impossible.,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning
explanation: the proposition (endless growth is impossible) is supported by its own premise (the impossibility of endless growth). this creates a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared, as the conclusion does not provide any evidence or reasoning outside of itself to support the claim.",False
510,"I really felt if I had stayed in single-sex, I would have been unprepared for life after high school, socially speaking.",nothing,"initial thoughts: the statement seems to be an example of the ""appeal to fear"" fallacy as it is attempting to scare the reader into believing that not attending a co-ed high school will result in being unprepared for life after high school, socially speaking. however, this argument does not provide any evidence or reason to support this claim, making it an argument based on fear rather than logic or evidence.

final answer: appeal to fear.",False
511,Non-European immigrants should be accepted in Europe.,nothing,"answer: nothing

expert 1: the statement does not present an argument, nor does it make a claim that can be classified as a fallacy. it is simply stating a position.

expert 2: given the lack of an argument and any potential fallacies, we need to look for a premise or conclusion that could potentially be questioned or challenged. however, there are no statements made that can be classified as such.

expert 3: if we were to assume that the statement is presented as a claim, then it would not be possible to classify any fallacy since there is no logical error or invalid reasoning provided in this statement. the position stated simply suggests acceptance of immigrants without any conditions or implications for other matters.",True
512,"I don’t think school children should spend as much time as they usually do isolated by age, let alone sex.",nothing,"this statement appears to be an example of the ""appeal to tradition"" fallacy. here's the breakdown of thinking for three experts:

expert 1: the statement suggests that schoolchildren have historically been segregated by both age and sex. however, this practice is not necessary in today's modern education system.

expert 2: the argument implies that because something has traditionally been done a certain way, it should continue to be done that way. this is ignoring the fact that societal norms and practices change over time.

expert 3: the conclusion of the statement is based on the assumption that traditional schooling methods are optimal for modern education. however, this assumption does not take into account the potential benefits and drawbacks of changing these methods.

in this case, all three experts come to the agreement that 'answer: appeal to tradition'.",False
513,"People are not being abused. Many new companies operate in other countries for fair wages, offering opportunities that they would not otherwise have. At the same time, American citizens benefit by manufacturing efficiency and not driving American business further into debt.",nothing,"answer: appeal to consequence (fallacy of accident)

explanation step 1 (expert a): identified a cause-effect relationship between american companies operating in other countries and fair wages being offered, but this is not necessarily causation as there may be other factors at play.

explanation step 2 (expert b): recognized that the argument attempts to justify a claim by appealing to a positive consequence rather than providing evidence for the original claim itself, which is the fallacy of accident.

explanation step 3 (expert c): agreed with experts a and b, concluding that the statement employs an appeal to consequence as a fallacy.",False
514,"Yes, there's is no way that they could fake such an event. There is a lot proof, such as video footage and rocks brought back that could not be faked.",nothing,answer: appeal to authority (the experts are assuming that the video footage and rocks are undeniable evidence without providing any justification for why this is so),False
515,"I really felt if I had stayed in single-sex, I would have been unprepared for life after high school, socially speaking.",nothing,"answer: appeal to worse problems

explanation step 1 (expert 1): the argument is trying to make the scenario better by comparing it to a worse case scenario (life outside of single-sex high school).

explanation step 2 (expert 2): there is no evidence or reason provided for the claim that being unprepared socially is a consequence of attending a single-sex high school.

explanation step 3 (expert 3, final agreement): the fact that life outside of single-sex high school could be worse does not mean that the current problem (attending a single-sex high school) is not important. the argument relies on this comparison to make its scenario seem better, but fails to provide evidence or reason for its claim.",False
516,"Terror has proven itself to be a real and unignorable danger, thus something has to be done.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): the statement seems to be using fear as the primary motivator for accepting the conclusion, which aligns with the appeal to fear fallacy. however, it's essential to find out if there is a valid premise supporting the claim that terror is a real and unignorable danger before making a final judgment.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning to back up the claim that something must be done. it simply states the conclusion without any justification, which can lead people to accept it without critical thinking, another characteristic of the appeal to fear fallacy.

step 3 (expert 3): since there is no counterargument presented and the statement relies solely on the emotional impact of fear, we can conclude that this argument uses the appeal to fear fallacy to persuade people to accept the conclusion without rational evaluation.

answer: appeal to fear",False
517,The reason for the supporters of the war on terror is 9/11.,nothing,"initial step: appeal to emotion (appeal to fear)
reasoning: the reasoning behind this statement relies heavily on the emotional impact of 9/11, rather than providing evidence or logical arguments to support the continuation of the war on terror.

second step: circular reasoning
reasoning: the statement also creates a circular argument where the emotional response (fear) caused by 9/11 is used as justification for continued involvement in the war on terror, and the fact that we are involved in the war on terror is used to validate the fear caused by 9/11.

final answer: circular reasoning",False
518,The Islamist terrorists are a serious threat to each form of progressive society.,nothing,"'answer: appeal to fear'

step 1: recognizing the use of fear to motivate acceptance of an idea (the threat posed by islamist terrorists) without evidence or reason to support it.

step 2: identifying that the claim about the threat is being used to justify a conclusion (progressive society is under threat), but no justification has been provided for this claim, making it fear-based rather than fact-based.

step 3: understanding that the absence of evidence or reason does not support the conclusion and is therefore an example of an appeal to fear fallacy.",False
519,"With the goal in mind to improve everyone's situation, growth is good for a country.",nothing,"step 1: appeal to positive emotion - the statement tries to make the argument apparently seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion of growth being good (making people happy), rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.
step 2: answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
520,People have been on the moon already.,nothing,"initial thoughts: the statement claims that people have been on the moon, which can be either true or false. however, the phrase ""already"" suggests a certain timeline or sequence of events.

expert 1: the argument seems to imply that there is an ongoing debate about whether or not people have been on the moon. this might indicate an appeal to tradition fallacy, as some argue that because it happened in the past, it should not be allowed (in this case, the idea being challenged). however, that's not exactly what the statement says, so let's explore further.

expert 2: the fact that people have indeed been on the moon is well-documented and not up for debate among scientific experts. therefore, it seems unlikely that we are dealing with an appeal to tradition fallacy in this case. let's look at other possibilities.

expert 3: if someone was claiming that people haven’t been on the moon based on their personal beliefs or emotions, it would be an example of an appeal to anger fallacy, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. the statement seems factual in nature, so let's consider other types of fallacies.

expert 1: given that the claim is a known fact and not subjective, we can rule out many fallacies related to emotions or personal biases. it appears the statement is simply stating an accepted truth, so it seems our final answer is ""nothing"". there is no identified logical fallacy in this statement.",True
521,Nuclear energy is a cheap power source.,nothing,"step 1: the statement suggests that nuclear energy is always cheaper than other power sources, which is an overgeneralization without qualifying factors like location, cost of infrastructure, maintenance costs, etc.
step 2: this can be considered as a form of 'appeal to simplicity' fallacy, where the argument oversimplifies a complex issue and presents it as if it has a simple solution or characteristic.
step 3: however, since the argument does not rely on fear or emotion to persuade but rather oversimplifies an issue, it is different from other fallacies such as 'appeal to anger', 'appeal to positive emotion' and 'appeal to pity'.
answer: appeal to simplicity",False
522,School uniforms do not make school a more effective place to learn.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): initial observation of the statement, noting it is an argument against a specific claim about the effectiveness of school uniforms on learning environment.

step 2 (expert 2): determining that no fear or emotion-based reasoning is being used to persuade in the given statement.

step 3 (expert 3): examining for any use of an unqualified authority as evidence, finding none.

step 4 (expert 1): analyzing for an appeal to a worst problem or comparison to another scenario, detecting no such use.

step 5 (expert 2): checking for circular reasoning and finding none.

step 6 (expert 3): investigating if the arguer is trying to discredit the argument by associating it with negative entities, finding no evidence of guilt by association.

step 7 (expert 1): determining whether emotions are being used as a substitute for actual evidence in the argument, and finding none.

step 8 (expert 2): examining if the arguer is misrepresenting or exaggerating the opposing viewpoint, finding no signs of straw man fallacy.

step 9 (expert 3): checking for any historical preferences or traditions being used as evidence in the argument, detecting none.

step 10 (expert 1): investigating if the term used is ambiguous and causing confusion, determining that it is not.

step 11 (expert 2): examining for any logical fallacy where a truth about the whole is assumed to be true of the parts, finding no evidence of fallacy of division.

step 12 (expert 3): evaluating if the arguer is distracting from the truth by appealing to pity, and finding none.

step 13 (expert 1): assessing whether emotions are being manipulated to make the argument seem reasonable, determining no such manipulation is present.

answer: nothing",True
523,I highly recommend a co-ed school.,nothing,"answer: appeal to authority (without proper qualification)

expert 1: the statement suggests that this person is an expert on the topic of education, but it does not specify what the qualifications are for being an expert in this context.
expert 2: since we don't know the qualifications of the expert, it's unclear if they truly have the authority to make such a claim about co-ed schools.
expert 3: the statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support that a co-ed school is beneficial, only that the speaker is an ""expert"". thus, it can be classified as appeal to authority (without proper qualification).",False
524,"Social education is important, alongside academics. The real world is not segregated, nor are universities.",nothing,"step 1 (expert a): this statement seems like it's trying to establish the importance of social education by stating a claim about the real-world and universities not being segregated. however, the statement doesn't necessarily provide any evidence or reason for why social education is important, so it might be an example of 'appeal to emotion'.

step 2 (expert b): the appeal to emotion could potentially be a valid classification if we consider that the statement is trying to evoke a positive feeling about social education by using the claim that universities and the real world are not segregated. however, it could also be considered as an 'appeal to false authority' if the implication is that since universities and the real world aren't segregated, then they are authorities on the importance of social education.

step 3 (expert c): if we consider the possibility that the statement is implying that because universities and the real world are not segregated, therefore they deem social education as important, it could be an example of 'appeal to tradition'. however, if we focus on the fact that the statement doesn't provide any evidence or reason for why social education is important, regardless of the implication about universities and the real world, then it remains an 'appeal to emotion'.

final answer: appeal to emotion.",False
525,"High schools should provide daycare services for students who have children, because it is not legit to exclude students who have children from certain possibilities to advance in society and to cut down their freedom in educational issues in an unproportional manner.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, 'appeal to positive emotion')

1st step: the argument mentions the positive outcome of making it easier for students with children to advance in society, which is intended to make the argument seem reasonable.
2nd step: however, this does not provide substantial evidence in favor of the action being proposed. instead, it appeals to the position emotion, rather than giving facts or reasons.",False
526,We need drug testing to ensure fair competition.,nothing,"initial thoughts: this statement appeals to a perceived authority (drug testing experts, sports associations) and may also use an argument from fear (doping athletes could gain unfair advantage). however, it's not clear if the statement is making a circular argument or using guilt by association.

first step: the statement uses an appeal to an (alleged) authority in the form of drug testing experts and sports associations.

second step: we are unsure if the statement makes a circular argument or uses guilt by association, as it does not explicitly state that all athletes who don't undergo drug testing are automatically cheating, nor does it suggest that all those who cheat do not undergo drug testing.

third step: upon further consideration, the statement does not use guilt by association since it does not claim that everyone who doesn't undergo drug testing is a bad athlete or a cheater.

final answer: the statement uses an appeal to (false) authority.",False
527,"Yes, global warming is a serious issue.",nothing,"initial classification: appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion)

reasoning: the statement uses a positive emotional response ('serious') to make the argument seem reasonable without providing substantial evidence in favor of the claim that global warming is an issue.

second classification: slippery slope fallacy

reasoning: the argument implies that if we do not consider global warming as a serious issue, it will lead to negative consequences. however, there is no justification or evidence provided for this premise.

final answer: slippery slope fallacy (combining the two classifications)",False
528,There are some reasons for America's war on terror.,nothing,"initial expert response: appeal to fear. the statement presents a vague threat (""america's war on terror"") and uses it to justify unstated reasons, capitalizing on the audience's fear of potential danger to accept the conclusion without questioning its validity.

second expert response: nothing (no explicit fallacy identified). while the initial expert identified an emotional appeal, there is no stated premise or conclusion for a fallacy to be evaluated against.

third expert response: appeal to tradition. the statement implies that the reasons for america's war on terror might be rooted in historical precedents or past strategies, suggesting that current actions are justified because they have been done before.

final answer: answer: appeal to tradition",True
529,"They certainly could be more violent. The thing with Quentin Tarantino is that he understands the separation between real life and movies. He understands that movies are supposed to be wild and outrageous and that is exactly what his movies are known for, especially when it comes to violence.",nothing,"answer: appeal to (false) authority
explanation: the claim that quentin tarantino understands the separation between real life and movies, and that this understanding explains why his movies are known for their violence, is presented as a fact based on an alleged authority (quentin tarantino). however, it would require supporting evidence to show that tarantino's understanding of this separation actually influences the level of violence in his films.",False
530,"They brought several kilos of moon rocks back to earth, and you cannot simply fake four billion years old rock material.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of the fallacy known as 'appeal to authority.' the argument relies on the fact that the rocks are from the moon, which is presented as evidence by experts.

step 2 (expert 2): however, the statement does not explicitly state who these alleged authorities are or what their field of expertise is in relation to the authenticity of the moon rocks. therefore, it's possible that this argument could be challenged if the identity and credibility of the experts aren't clearly established.

step 3 (expert 3): after considering the argument, we conclude that it can still be classified as an 'appeal to authority,' but with a caveat: the argument is weakened because it does not explicitly identify the authorities involved or their relevant expertise.

answer: appeal to authority (with a caveat)",False
531,"Christiano Ronaldo hat viele Neider, doch er ist wohl mit Abstand der momentan beste Spieler der Welt. (Cristiano Ronaldo has many detractors, but he is probably by far the best player in the world at the moment.)",nothing,"step 1: circular reasoning
step 2: appeal to authority (false) - the expert's assertion that cristiano ronaldo is ""by far the best player in the world"" is not supported by their claim that he has many detractors. detractors do not make someone the best, regardless of the context.
step 3: nothing - no other fallacies are apparent from this statement, as it does not rely on fear, association, emotions, or tradition to argue its point, and it is not misleading or equivocal in its language.

answer: circular reasoning / appeal to authority (false)",True
532,It helps companies lower labor costs and increased realization of economics of scale.,nothing,"the statement seems to use an argument that appeals to a positive emotion, specifically economic benefits (lowering labor costs and realizing economies of scale). however, it does not provide any substantial evidence or reason for this conclusion. therefore, the fallacy used in this statement is 'appeal to positive emotion'.

here's how each expert's reasoning might look like:

expert 1: the argument attempts to sway me with emotional appeals, so i would classify it as an appeal to emotion.

expert 2: the emotion being used here is economic benefits, specifically lowering labor costs and economies of scale. this fits the category of 'appeal to positive emotion'.

expert 3 (final answer): answer: appeal to positive emotion.",False
533,Microsoft is not the new apple.,nothing,"step 1: comparison between microsoft and apple.
step 2: identifying an argument based on the statement.
step 3: recognizing that the argument attempts to equate or liken two different entities (microsoft and apple).
step 4: noticing that the comparison is not supported by evidence, facts, or concrete similarities between the two companies.
step 5: realizing that the argument is making an assumption that microsoft has reached a similar level of success as apple, which cannot be proven without substantial evidence.
answer: nothing (no identified fallacy in this statement)",True
534,Nuclear power is an incredibly reasonable power source granted it is used by people who are responsible. It's the most effective energy source in the world and incredibly clean.,nothing,"the first expert might say: 'appeal to positive emotion' - the argument tries to make the reader believe that nuclear power is a good choice because it will make one happy, rather than providing evidence or reason for this claim.

the second expert might say: 'nothing' - there is no fallacy in the statement itself, but the argument could be strengthened by providing more substantial evidence and reasons to support the claim that nuclear power is a good choice.

the final expert might say: 'answer: nothing'. after considering the previous two experts' opinions, there is no identified fallacy in the statement as it stands, assuming the claims about nuclear power being an effective and clean energy source are supported by evidence and reasons. however, the argument could be strengthened by providing more substantial evidence and reasons to support these claims.",True
535,There is no denying that CO2 emissions and average temperature of the atmosphere both have gone up; there are many studies on it.,nothing,"'answer: nothing'. the statement does not contain any logical fallacy. it is stating a fact based on scientific research, and does not use fear, false authority, circular reasoning, guilt by association, appeal to anger, straw man, appeal to tradition, equivocation, fallacy of division, tu quoque, appeal to positive emotion or appeal to pity as arguments.",True
536,People become too involved with social media and fail to make real personal connections with others.,nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion

1st expert: the statement appeals to a negative emotional response (i.e., concern about failing to connect with others) to argue that social media usage leads to a lack of personal connections.
2nd expert: the argument does not provide any evidence or reasoning beyond emotional manipulation, making it an appeal to emotion fallacy.
3rd expert: agrees with the previous two experts' findings.

the final answer is 'answer: appeal to emotion'.",False
537,"Animals have a conscious mind. That means they deserve protection through law, like humans do. Nevertheless, they aren't as intelligent as humans, that's why they need a special law.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): equivocation - the term ""conscious mind"" is used ambiguously, as it can refer to various levels of awareness and self-awareness in both humans and animals.
step 2 (expert 2): appeal to emotion - the argument attempts to appeal to the positive emotions of compassion and empathy towards animals to justify a conclusion that requires other forms of evidence.
step 3 (expert 3): false dilemma - the argument presents only two choices: animals either have a conscious mind or they don't, when in reality, there might be an intermediate level of consciousness.
answer: appeal to emotion and false dilemma",False
538,"Current civil unrest in Turkey is partly based on resentment of other European governments. Given the governments aren't getting along, it seems like Turkey isn't ready.",nothing,answer: appeal to worse problems,False
539,"No, it's not worth the risk. So many people did already die because of radiation...",nothing,answer: appeal to fear,False
540,"If you don't allow animals to have rights, you shouldn't have them either.",nothing,"step 1: appeal to equality (or ""appeal to unfairness"")
- this argument assumes that if we do not grant animals certain rights, then it is unfair or hypocritical for us to claim those same rights for ourselves.

step 2: guilt by association
- the arguer is suggesting that because humans and animals are similar in some ways (i.e., both living beings), granting rights to one implies the same should be granted to the other, even if they differ significantly in many other ways relevant to the discussion of rights.

step 3: circular reasoning
- the assumption that it is hypocritical or unfair for humans not to extend rights to animals because we claim those same rights ourselves assumes the very point at issue - that humans and animals are equal in this respect, which was the initial conclusion of the argument.

answer: circular reasoning (or ""appeal to unfairness"")",False
541,We should allow animal testing for medical purposes.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion)
step 2: the argument is attempting to persuade by eliciting sympathy for animals used in medical research, rather than providing objective reasons and evidence.
step 3: this emotional manipulation does not provide a rational basis for the conclusion, therefore, it can be considered fallacious.
answer: appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion)",False
542,Democracy is good.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to positive emotion (appeal to emotions to make an argument seem reasonable)
step 2: none (no further steps are necessary as the first step has identified the fallacy)
answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
543,"Refugees mostly flee from the war, poverty, or tyranny in their countries. Unless these problems are solved to some extent and they have some other safe place to reside in, except EU, they should be welcome.",nothing,"answer: equivocation

expert 1: the statement uses the term ""refugees"" ambiguously, as it could refer to all refugees or only those who seek asylum in the eu.
expert 2: it is unclear what is meant by ""unless these problems are solved to some extent and they have some other safe place to reside in, except eu."" the phrase seems to imply that a solution within their own countries is not sufficient, but only if there is another safe place available outside of the eu.
expert 3: it appears that the statement assumes that a refugee's desire for asylum is based on their ability to find safety elsewhere, rather than their immediate need for protection and safety, regardless of other options available or lack thereof.",False
544,Rather than adopting stiffer penalties for drug use we should focus more on counseling. Drug trafficking is another story.,nothing,"step 1 (expert a): this statement appears to be an example of ""appeal to emotion"" fallacy, as it attempts to manipulate emotions in favor of the argument by suggesting a positive outcome (focusing on counseling) rather than providing substantial evidence.

step 2 (expert b): however, we can't definitively say that the statement is an example of ""appeal to emotion"" alone without evaluating the entire context or reasoning provided. it could also be related to other fallacies such as ""fallacy of division.""

step 3 (expert c): upon further analysis, it seems that we can't find any evidence of a fallacy in this statement at first glance. the argument proposes counseling over stiffer penalties for drug use and acknowledges the need to address drug trafficking separately. however, it may be argued that if the argument is based on the assumption that counseling is more effective than stricter punishments (an assumption that needs evidence), then we could categorize it as an ""appeal to emotion"" fallacy.

step 4 (expert a): i agree with expert c's reasoning, but i would like to emphasize that the argument is making a subjective evaluation (counseling over stricter punishments) without providing clear evidence or facts to support its claim, which could potentially lead to the use of emotions as a primary motivator. thus, we can classify this statement as an example of both ""appeal to emotion"" and ""argument from ignorance.""

step 5 (expert b): i concur with expert a's analysis that the argument is using subjective evaluation without supporting evidence. however, i think it's important to point out that the argument does not explicitly state that counseling should be prioritized over stricter punishments because of emotions, but rather focuses on the idea that counseling might be a more effective solution. so, while there may be an element of ""appeal to emotion,"" we can't definitively say it is the primary fallacy at play.

step 6 (expert c): upon further reflection, i agree with expert b that the argument is not solely focused on appealing to emotions but instead emphasizes the need for counseling as a more effective solution. we should revise our previous classification to focus on the lack of evidence or facts to support the claim made in the statement: ""argument from ignorance.""

answer: argument from ignorance",False
545,Computers should be allowed in classrooms.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): circular reasoning - the argument is that computers should be allowed because they can help improve learning, but the claim relies on the premise that computers are useful for learning, creating a circular argument.

step 2 (expert 2): appeal to tradition - while not explicitly stating so, the argument could be interpreted as suggesting that since computers have been used in classrooms in the past, they should continue to be allowed. however, this reasoning is flawed because the usefulness of computers today may differ from their effectiveness in the past.

step 3 (expert 3): nothing - the argument does not include any fallacy as it stands. it merely presents a statement without providing evidence or relying on irrational emotions or fallacious arguments.

final answer: nothing. the argument itself doesn't contain any specific fallacies, but it could be argued that the reasoning behind its premise may rely on circular reasoning or appeal to tradition if not further substantiated.",True
546,"Personally, I’d go co-ed.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of a fallacy known as ""appeal to tradition"". the argument is based on the historical practice of male and female genders being exclusively paired in education institutions, which is being used to argue against co-education.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it seems that the initial expert's reasoning can be further analyzed. the argument does not provide any evidence or logical explanation as to why the traditional practice should be maintained.

step 3 (expert 3): additionally, the statement does not address potential benefits of co-education or any negative consequences of continuing with single-gender education.

step 4 (all experts): given the lack of evidence and logical reasoning, as well as the absence of addressing potential advantages and disadvantages, we conclude that this statement employs the fallacy of ""appeal to tradition"".

answer: appeal to tradition",False
547,"Yes, because drug-use in professional-sport is quite common. If we don't test for drugs now, soon nobody will be able to take part there without taking drugs.",nothing,"answer: appeal to worse problems.
explanation: the argument uses a comparison to a worst case scenario (nobody being able to participate in professional sports without taking drugs) to make the current problem (not testing for drugs now) seem better, which is fallacious as it overlooks the importance of addressing the current problem and provides no evidence or reason for why the worst case scenario will occur.",False
548,"The instructions given in the New Testament, which Christians should observe, are peaceful and focused on love.",nothing,"the classification for this statement is ""appeal to authority"". this is because the argument assumes that the instructions given in the new testament hold an authoritative status that justifies their peaceful and loving nature without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption. while it is true that many christians view the new testament as an authoritative source, this does not mean that these instructions are inherently peaceful and loving without further examination or evidence.

here's a breakdown of one possible sequence of thought for three experts:

expert 1: the argument here seems to rely on the assumption that the new testament is an authoritative source. this suggests an 'appeal to authority.'

expert 2: that's correct, but let's consider if the new testament truly qualifies as an authority on peaceful and loving instructions in this context. it might be a religious text, but it doesn't necessarily mean that its teachings are universally peaceful and loving without any further examination or evidence.

expert 3: yes, i agree with both of you. the argument also overlooks the fact that many interpretations of religious texts can vary greatly among different groups, so there is no universally agreed-upon definition of peaceful and loving instructions. therefore, the final answer is 'appeal to authority'.",False
549,"Yes, our society definitely wants students to have children, for two reasons: First: students are smart, therefore their children might be smart, too. Second: older women have higher risks at giving birth. Students have the perfect age.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning
explanation: the first premise is that students are smart, and the second premise uses this to infer that their children will also be smart. this creates a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared.",False
550,Nuclear energy should be invested in more.,nothing,"step 1: identification of a potential argument from authority fallacy
reasoning: the statement suggests that because nuclear energy should be invested in more, it implies that the experts suggesting this are authorities on the topic. however, the speaker does not provide evidence as to why these individuals are qualified or knowledgeable about investing in nuclear energy.

step 2: evaluation of the potential fallacy
reasoning: upon examination, we find that there is no justification for assuming these individuals are authorities on this matter, making the argument based on their opinions questionable.

final answer: nothing (no clear fallacy found)",True
551,It allows to get useful data for human research.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to authority
step 2: false authority (differentiating between an expert and an expert on the specific topic)
step 3: nothing (since there is no further classification needed if it has been identified as a false appeal to authority)

answer: false authority",True
552,I don't think that's the case. Both companies serve different types of customers. Microsoft creates operating systems for the average pc-user whereas Apple has specialized in products for Yuppies.,nothing,"answer: appeal to stereotype

expert 1: assuming both companies cater only to specific groups (microsoft for pc users and apple for yuppies).
expert 2: arguing that because one company's customers fit a certain stereotype, the other company must do the same.
expert 3: both microsoft and apple have a wide range of customers beyond those initially mentioned, their marketing strategies may emphasize different demographics but they do not cater to specific groups exclusively.",False
553,It is against moral principles to torture or kill animals who feel pain.,nothing,"answer: guilt by association

expert 1: the statement suggests that if one is against the act of torturing or killing animals, then they are also against moral principles. this implies a negative connotation for those who do not support this action, thus connecting them to the morally reprehensible act of animal torture and killing.

expert 2: the connection made between the act of torturing/killing animals and moral principles is an unwarranted association based on emotional appeal rather than evidence or reason, which fits the definition of guilt by association.

expert 3: no further reasoning necessary as experts agree with expert 2's analysis.",False
554,"Yes, if someone is bad at school or has some misbehavior, additional time in school could help him to catch up for lost time.",nothing,"answer: appeal to positive emotion
explanation (step 1): the argument tries to make the action of giving additional time in school seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.",False
555,Testing animals should be approved.,nothing,"step 1: identifying the argument structure. - appeal to emotion fallacy (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)
step 2: determining the main claim and conclusion. - the main claim is that testing animals should be approved. conclusion: not explicitly stated but implied that testing animals will have a positive effect or result.
step 3: identifying the primary motivator in the argument. - emotional manipulation to make the argument seem reasonable rather than providing substantial evidence.
step 4: evaluating whether there is justification for the use of emotional appeal. - no, there is no justification for using emotional appeal as a means to justify testing animals without proper evidence or reasoning.
answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
556,Of course they have been on the moon.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): the statement is an example of 'appeal to authority'. the speaker is using the fact that these individuals are experts as evidence for their claim, but without providing any further information or justification for why their expertise makes them reliable sources in this specific context.

step 2 (expert 2): while it's true that an expert's opinion can be used as evidence in an argument, the key here is whether or not the expert is actually qualified to speak on this particular topic. without knowing who these 'three different experts' are and what their area(s) of expertise are, we cannot determine if they are authorities on whether humans have been to the moon.

step 3 (expert 1): a fair point, but even though we don't know their specific areas of expertise, it is generally understood that scientists who study space and astronauts would be qualified to speak about lunar exploration. however, without additional evidence or corroboration, the claim remains unverified.

step 4 (expert 2): indeed, even if we accept these individuals as experts on the topic of moon landings, there are other ways to verify whether humans have indeed walked on the moon. for example, photographs, videos, and other scientific data provide evidence for this claim. without mentioning any of these pieces of evidence, the statement is still lacking sufficient support.

step 5 (expert 1): in agreement. the statement does not present enough evidence to definitively prove that humans have been on the moon, making it an example of a fallacy as there is a lack of evidence or reasoning provided to support the claim.

answer: nothing (the statement itself is not classified as any specific fallacy, but rather it's determined that the statement does not provide sufficient evidence to support its claim).",True
557,"I think it can have an effect on students that will get them to correct their behavior, as they may be embarrassed that they have detention. However, kids who get detention all the time end up enjoying it because all of their friends are in there and it becomes more of a playground, instead of punishment.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)

expert 1: the argument seems to be trying to make the conclusion seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion of students feeling embarrassed, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action taken or proposed.

expert 2: additionally, it appears that the fear of being embarrassed is being used as a primary motivator for students to correct their behavior.

expert 3: in conclusion, the argument is using an emotional appeal (positive emotion) to make its conclusion seem reasonable without providing any substantial evidence or justification.",False
558,Many people are already killing themselves because they are terminally ill. It is their choice to choose if they want to live or die. A doctor should respect their choice and assist them either way.,nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion
explanation: the argument tries to make the conclusion seem reasonable by appealing to the position of emotion, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action. it plays on the emotional response to the suffering of terminally ill people to justify a controversial act (assisted suicide).",False
559,Marijuana should be allowed as a medical drug.,nothing,"step 1: initial assessment (all experts)
- assess whether the statement is about an argument or proposition.

step 2: identify the fallacy type (expert 1)
- determine if the statement presents an opinion without providing evidence or reasoning, suggesting a possible appeal to emotion.

step 3: classify the fallacy (expert 1)
- classify the identified fallacy as 'appeal to positive emotion'.

step 4: confirm the classification (expert 2)
- verify whether the presented argument employs an emotional appeal to sway the opinion on the topic.

step 5: final agreement (both experts)
- both experts agree that the statement represents an 'appeal to positive emotion'.

answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
560,"Marijuana has been shown in some cases to alleviate negative side effects from chemotherapy treatments, even when other treatments for the same side effects were ineffective. Patients deserve legal access to medicines which, when prescribed by a physician, provide relief for their symptoms.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically 'appeal to positive emotion')

step 1: the argument tries to sway the listener with a promise of happiness (""if you buy this ticket, i’m sure you will be happy!"") instead of providing substantial evidence in favor of the action.

step 2: although the statement is not explicitly saying that legalizing marijuana will make people happy, it does imply this by associating the use of marijuana with relief from negative side effects and therefore a positive emotional state. this still falls under 'appeal to positive emotion' as it relies on manipulating emotions to seem reasonable rather than providing evidence.

step 3: there is no other fallacy that fits this statement, so we can conclude that the final answer is 'answer: appeal to positive emotion'.",False
561,"If a serious disease can be cured with the help of animal testing, we shouldn't hesitate.",nothing,"'answer: appeal to emotion'

first expert: this statement is attempting to use an emotional appeal to sway someone into accepting animal testing for medical research.
second expert: however, it doesn't provide any evidence or reason supporting the claim that a serious disease can be cured with animal testing; it only appeals to the emotions of pity and concern for human health.
third expert: furthermore, the argument assumes that animal testing is the only method available to cure serious diseases, which may not be the case. it also ignores potential ethical issues related to animal rights and welfare. therefore, the use of emotional appeal without providing evidence or reasoning makes it a fallacy.",False
562,It makes less environmental damage in the short run than burning fossil fuel.,nothing,"answer: appeal to worse problems

step 1 (expert 1): the argument implies that because it causes less environmental damage in the short term, it is acceptable. however, the long-term consequences of this action have not been considered.

step 2 (expert 2): the argument ignores the fact that all actions have both immediate and long-term effects on the environment. a truly environmentally friendly choice would take both aspects into account.

step 3 (expert 3): the comparison between this action and burning fossil fuel only focuses on the short term, which is an oversimplification of the situation. it is a fallacy to make a scenario seem better by comparing it to the worst case scenario (appeal to worse problems).",False
563,"Greek should leave Eurozone, because the consequences will be minimal for the Eurozone. The consequences will be hard for Greeks, but they got to this situation themselves.",nothing,"answer: appeal to worse problems

explanation step 1: the argument attempts to make a scenario seem better by comparing it to the worst case scenario (the consequences for the eurozone will be minimal).
explanation step 2: the fact that there are hard consequences for greeks does not mean those consequences are irrelevant, and does not negate the potential negative impact on the eurozone.
explanation step 3: there is no evidence provided to support that the consequences for the eurozone will be minimal.",False
564,Drug testing athletes is justified.,nothing,"initial thoughts: this statement seems to be presenting an argument without providing any evidence or reasoning, and instead using a claim of justification. however, the exact fallacy type is not immediately apparent due to the lack of counterargument or comparison.

step 1 (expert 1): the statement appears to use an appeal to authority as it presents drug testing of athletes as justified based on the implicit assumption that drug testing is supported by the experts who implement it, without providing any further justification or evidence.

step 2 (expert 2): although the statement uses an appeal to authority, it does not clearly commit to a fallacy since no false or irrelevant authority is claimed or implied. the argument does not use fear, traditional beliefs, misrepresentation, or other fallacies described above.

step 3 (expert 3): the argument does not present a scenario better by comparing it to the worst case scenario, nor does it rely on emotions such as anger or pity as evidence for its claim. it also doesn't use circular reasoning or guilt by association.

final answer: answer: nothing (the statement may use an appeal to authority, but it does not commit to a fallacy due to lack of false or irrelevant claims.)",True
565,I support the strike in Deutsche Post. Everyone deserves fair working conditions.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of ""appeal to emotion"", as the argument is being made based on an emotional response (everyone deserves fair working conditions) rather than evidence or reason.

step 2 (expert 2): the use of the term ""everyone"" suggests a universally applicable standard, which could be a form of circular reasoning if the assumption is that those who support the strike are included in the group that deserves fair working conditions.

step 3 (expert 3): however, the statement does not explicitly state or imply that those supporting the strike are the only ones who deserve fair working conditions, so it can be argued that circular reasoning is not present here. instead, this argument may be considered a form of ""appeal to sympathy"", as it seeks to evoke empathy towards the workers in deutsche post by suggesting they deserve fair working conditions.

final answer: appeal to sympathy",False
566,Television didn't destroy the communication among friends and families.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): the argument is making a claim about the present state of things (television did not destroy...).
step 2 (expert 2): however, there is no explicit statement or evidence provided to support the claim that television didn't destroy communication among friends and families.
step 3 (expert 3): therefore, the argument lacks justification, making it a fallacy by omission or appeal to ignorance.
answer: appeal to ignorance",False
567,Children need daycare. But university is not the right place for daycare services. University is a place for education. There are enough existing public and private daycare-services. Put your children there.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to tradition (the argument assumes that because universities have not traditionally provided daycare, they should not do so now)
step 2: appeal to fear (the argument implicitly suggests that if universities provide daycare, it could negatively impact the quality of education provided)
step 3: fallacy of division (the argument infers that because universities are for education, they cannot be used for other purposes like providing daycare, without considering other possible uses of universities)

final answer: answer: appeal to tradition, fallacy of division",False
568,"The main point of high schools is educating, that's true. Nevertheless, university provides services, which you can get outside of university as well. Think about sports-fields or dining-halls. Why not daycare?",nothing,"answer: appeal to worse problems

step 1 (expert a): the argument is trying to make a scenario better by comparing it to other scenarios (university provides services that you can get outside of university, so why not daycare?). this is an attempt to make the current problem seem less important.

step 2 (expert b): the comparison made between services like sports-fields or dining-halls and daycare is irrelevant and misleading because they serve different purposes. daycare provides childcare services that are essential for many families, especially those with working parents. it's not the same as a sports field or dining hall, which can be easily replaced by other alternatives.

step 3 (expert c): the comparison between daycare and other services is still off-topic, as it doesn't address the main point of high schools being to educate students. providing additional services like daycare does not detract from this primary goal.

step 4 (expert a): upon reevaluating, it seems that there is no fallacy in this statement but rather a misunderstanding of the role and purpose of high schools versus universities. however, the argument could be seen as an appeal to worse problems by trying to make university seem less necessary because some services can be obtained elsewhere.

final answer: answer: appeal to worse problems (if all experts agree on this assessment)",False
569,The grading system is not effective because it doesn't consider all types of learning styles of the students.,nothing,"this statement appears to be an example of the fallacy called ""appeal to worse problems"". the reasoning behind this classification is as follows:

1. first expert: the statement implies that if a grading system does not cater to all learning styles, it is ineffective. however, it does not address the fact that there might be other reasons for its ineffectiveness.

2. second expert: the argument suggests that because the grading system doesn't account for all learning styles, it should be considered ineffective. this is equivalent to saying, ""if you don't do this specific thing, then everything will go wrong."" in this case, it's not necessarily true that the grading system being ineffective is solely due to its lack of consideration for different learning styles.

3. third expert: the final argument presented is that a grading system being ineffective because it does not cater to all learning styles is based on the premise that every student should be assessed in the same way, which assumes that all students have the same learning style. this assumption overlooks individual differences among students and ignores alternative explanations for the ineffectiveness of a grading system.

answer: appeal to worse problems",False
570,Social networking binds society closer together.,nothing,"answer: appeal to positive emotion

expert 1: the statement appeals to the desire for positivity or happiness in people, which is a form of emotional manipulation.
expert 2: by encouraging the belief that using social networking will make one happier, it seeks to make an argument seem reasonable without providing substantial evidence in its favor.
expert 3: this emotional appeal is being used as the primary motivator for people to accept the idea of social networking binding society closer together.",False
571,Neuer is the best goalkeeper of the Soccer World Cup 2014.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to (false) authority - the statement assumes that neuer is the best goalkeeper because he played in the soccer world cup 2014, but this event doesn't make him an authority on himself being the best.

step 2: guilt by association - there is no direct association being made here. however, if someone were to argue that since neuer was the goalkeeper for the winning team in the world cup 2014, then he must be better than any other goalkeeper from losing teams, this would fall under guilt by association.

step 3: nothing - there is no apparent fallacy being made based on the statement provided. the argument is simply stating that neuer was the best goalkeeper of the world cup 2014 and doesn't involve any logical errors or emotional manipulation.

answer: nothing",True
572,"There are many cases where abortion should be legal. E.g., if a mother would die during the birth process, the state should leave the decision to her, as it is her life.",nothing,"step 1: appeal to fear - the statement uses fear (dying during the birth process) as a primary motivator for accepting the conclusion that abortion in such cases should be legal.

step 2: nothing - there is no evidence or reasoning provided in the statement that directly supports its claim, so no other fallacies can be identified at this point.

step 3: none of the experts realize they are wrong or have any other insights to contribute.

answer: nothing",True
573,Tests can be also conducted by numerical simulations.,nothing,"in this scenario, the three experts are analyzing a statement where someone is arguing that god does not exist because they haven't experienced him personally. the fallacy being addressed here is equivocation.

expert 1: the argument assumes that personal experience with a higher power is the only way to validate its existence. this oversimplifies the definition of what can be considered evidence for something, as there are various ways to establish facts and truths.

expert 2: additionally, the argument equates the absence of personal experience with certainty of non-existence. however, there may be other explanations or reasons for not encountering such an entity, which again oversimplifies the definition of what can constitute evidence.

expert 3: lastly, the argument fails to consider the possibility that others might have experienced god in ways different from the speaker, or that belief in something can be based on faith rather than personal experience alone. the argument equates personal experience with objective reality, which is a form of equivocation.

the final answer would be: 'answer: equivocation'.",False
574,"No, because computers distract students. Very often they use computers for reasons not related to the class, which ultimately diminishes the educational effect of the class.",nothing,answer: appeal to fear,False
575,Heavy Metal is just a genre.,nothing,"step 1: initial observation - the statement is about heavy metal being just a genre.

step 3: analysis - the statement does not use any logical fallacies as it is simply stating a fact about music genres.

576,Flying cars are the consequent step forward in mobility technology.,nothing,"initial thought (expert 1): this seems like an argument that a particular solution (flying cars) is the best solution for a given problem (mobility). however, it doesn't provide any reasons or evidence to support why flying cars are superior over existing alternatives.

initial thought (expert 2): the statement is making a claim about what will happen in the future without providing any justification or evidence. this appears to be an example of an argument from ignorance or prediction fallacy.

initial thought (expert 3): the argument seems to assume that because one solution (flying cars) exists, it must be the logical next step forward. this is a classic example of the fallacy of the consequent where the conclusion follows logically only if the premise is true but the premise has not been proven or justified.

final answer: fallacy of the consequent",False
577,"The animals are a part of nature like us and we, as humans, occupy their natural places. Not to harm them any further, they should have special rights.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion
explanation: the argument is trying to manipulate the emotions of the reader by appealing to sympathy for animals. this emotional appeal is used to make the argument appear reasonable without providing substantial evidence in favor of animal rights.",False
578,"Yes, there is obviously a need for it. I've read that about 5 percent of all students have children. Students usually have to attend lectures and won't be home until 4 pm.",nothing,"answer: appeal to tradition
explanation: the argument infers that because it was acceptable in the past (students having children attending lectures), it is acceptable today, which assumes historical preferences are correct without considering current circumstances or changes.",False
579,Co-ed schools are better for life.,nothing,"step 1 (expert a): appeal to tradition
* the argument relies on historical preferences of co-ed schools being better, without considering if this is still the case today.

step 2 (expert b): nothing
* the statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning for why co-ed schools are better for life.

step 3 (expert c): guilt by association
* the argument could be interpreted as suggesting that single-sex schools are inferior, because they are associated with being separate from co-ed schools.

step 4 (expert a): guilt by association
* the argument could also be interpreted as suggesting that single-sex schools are inferior, because they deviate from the traditional model of co-ed schools.

step 5 (expert b): nothing
* the statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning for why co-ed schools are better for life, nor does it address the potential negatives associated with guilt by association.

step 6 (expert c): circular reasoning
* the argument could be interpreted as suggesting that because co-ed schools have been around for a long time, they must therefore be good or superior, which assumes what is being proved in the first place.

final answer: guilt by association, circular reasoning",True
580,Christians should follow the rules of their religion.,nothing,"step 1: identification of the argument structure
- argument: christians should follow the rules of their religion.

step 2: explanation of the argument
- the speaker suggests that christian individuals are expected to adhere to religious laws or regulations as part of being a christian.

step 3: fallacy identification - comparison with fallacies described above
- this argument does not appear to use fear, false authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, appeal to anger, straw man fallacy, or appeal to tradition.
- the argument also does not seem to involve ambiguity (equivocation) or division of wholes into parts.
- the argument does not use pity to distract from the conclusion, nor does it manipulate positive emotions to make the argument reasonable.

step 4: final answer
- the argument is neither a fallacy nor an appeal to emotion in this context.",False
581,"No, the Scandinavian schools use another system and their students are the world's best. We are just average. It is not that effective.",nothing,"this statement appears to use the fallacy of appeal to authority. the statement implies that since the scandinavian schools have students considered as the ""world’s best"", their education system must be superior, and therefore it follows that other systems like ours are ineffective. however, this argument assumes that the success of one educational system can be directly attributed to its effectiveness without considering other factors.

here is a possible sequence of thinking for three experts:

1st expert (identifying the fallacy): this statement assumes that because scandinavian schools have students who are considered as the world’s best, their education system is superior to all others.

2nd expert (building on previous insight): however, the quality of a school system cannot be determined by the achievements of its top students alone. it ignores other factors such as student background, resources available, teaching methodology, and many more.

3rd expert (final agreement): therefore, the statement uses an appeal to authority fallacy by assuming that a successful educational system is automatically effective without considering all relevant factors.

answer: appeal to authority",False
582,"A group that refuses any diplomatic way on problem-solving and uses weapons straight away cannot be defeated without being at level with them, even though the number of those operations should be kept as small as possible.",nothing,"answer: appeal to fear

step 1 (expert 1): the statement implies that if we do not use force, we will lose, which instills fear of defeat in the audience. this is a form of an appeal to fear fallacy because there's no justification or evidence provided for the claim that diplomatic solutions cannot be used or will result in defeat.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement also assumes that the only options available are using weapons or diplomacy, ignoring other possible peaceful alternatives like mediation, negotiations, etc.

step 3 (expert 3): lastly, the statement suggests that minimizing the number of operations should be a priority to avoid conflict escalation, but this is not supported by any evidence or reasoning, making it an invalid point in the argument.

therefore, the final answer is: answer: appeal to fear",False
583,Greece should leave the Eurozone because Europe needs to keep a responsible fiscal politics.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this argument is an example of the appeal to authority fallacy, as the statement implies that europe (as a whole) needs to have responsible fiscal politics, but does not provide evidence or reasoning for why the experts in question are authorities on this matter.

step 2 (expert 2): while it may be true that greece has issues with its fiscal policies, this argument also exhibits the fallacy of division by assuming that the problems with greece's fiscal politics are representative of all member states within the eurozone.

step 3 (expert 3): additionally, the statement implies that greece leaving the eurozone would result in better fiscal politics for europe as a whole, but this conclusion is not supported by any evidence or reasoning. this can be classified as an appeal to fear fallacy, since the idea of responsible fiscal policies for all of europe is frightening enough for some people to overlook the lack of justification for the conclusion.

answer: appeal to fear and fallacy of division",False
584,Nuclear power is an effective and reasonable energy source.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be an argument from authority, as it implies that because these experts are doing the classification, their conclusion must be correct. however, without knowing who these experts are or what qualifications they have in this specific field, it is not yet clear if they truly are authorities on the topic.

step 1 (expert 2): if these experts are indeed authorities, then their argument would be stronger if they provide evidence and reasoning as to why nuclear power is effective and reasonable. in this case, a lack of sufficient supporting evidence weakens the argument.

step 1 (expert 3): the statement also fails to acknowledge potential drawbacks or controversies associated with nuclear power, such as safety concerns, waste management issues, and proliferation risks. without addressing these aspects, the argument remains incomplete and potentially misleading.

answer: nothing",True
585,"Yes, humans are not only mainly responsible for all current environmental problems, but we are also directly affected. We face problems like natural catastrophes, destruction of farmland, destruction of inhabitable areas, and loss of resources.",nothing,"answer: appeal to fear

step 1 (expert 1): the statement implies that the consequences of not addressing environmental problems (natural catastrophes, destruction of farmland, etc.) will be so dire that they outweigh any other considerations. this is an appeal to fear because it relies on frightening people into action, rather than providing evidence or reason for why we should address these issues.

step 2 (expert 2): however, the statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning for why humans are mainly responsible for these environmental problems. the claim that humans are directly affected by these problems is also presented as self-evident, without providing any additional details or context.

step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, the statement assumes that the only option available is to take immediate and drastic action to address these environmental problems. this oversimplifies a complex issue and ignores the possibility of other solutions or approaches.

therefore, the experts agree that this statement is an appeal to fear fallacy.",False
586,"Sorry, but your argument is a racist one. Germany has already acted like this in the past. We may not act like this again if we want to get a better reputation in the world.",nothing,answer: appeal to tradition,False
587,It will reduce crime.,nothing,"answer: appeal to fear

step 1: identified a statement that suggests a conclusion based on the premise of fear, not backed by evidence or reason.

step 2: recognized that the idea of reducing crime is frightening enough for many people to overlook the fact that this is a premise without justification.

step 3: realized that there is no evidence or reason provided for the claim that reducing crime will occur, resulting in them accepting the conclusion without question due to fear.",False
588,You should test athletes.,nothing,"initial thoughts: the argument suggests that testing athletes is necessary without providing any evidence or reason for this conclusion, and instead relies on an emotional appeal (fear) of potential negative consequences if the testing is not done.

step 1: appeal to fear
initial thoughts: the claim is based on a premise without justification, resulting in people accepting the conclusion without adequate reasoning or evidence.

step 2: nothing (since the previous step identified the primary fallacy)
final answer: appeal to fear",True
589,Tests can be also conducted by numerical simulations.,nothing,"this exercise involves three experts performing a collaborative reasoning process to classify a statement based on identified fallacies. here is a step-by-step breakdown of how they might approach this task:

1. expert 1 (e1): recognizes that the given statement seems to be an example of ""appeal to tradition"" as it uses historical preferences (marriage being between a man and a woman) as evidence against gay marriage.
2. expert 2 (e2): agrees with e1, but points out that the statement also contains some elements of ""equivocation,"" since tradition can be understood in multiple ways and is not necessarily relevant to the validity of contemporary social issues.
3. expert 3 (e3): recognizes both 'appeal to tradition' and 'equivocation,' but adds that the argument also employs a 'false dichotomy' because it assumes that there are only two possibilities for marriage: heterosexual or non-existent, while disregarding other valid forms of marriage like same-sex unions.
4. (no more disagreements among experts)
5. expert 1, 2, and 3: collaboratively reach a final agreement on the fallacy classification, taking into account all observations made by each expert.

the final answer is: 'answer: appeal to tradition, equivocation, false dichotomy.'",False
590,"No, because computers distract students. Very often they use computers for reasons not related to the class, which ultimately diminishes the educational effect of the class.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be an argument that uses a correlation without establishing causation - fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc. the argument assumes that because students often use computers for non-educational purposes during class, the use of computers causes diminished educational effects. however, it is not established that the use of computers necessarily leads to this effect, as there may be other factors at play.

step 2 (expert 2): furthermore, the argument seems to be making a sweeping generalization about all students being distracted by computers, which ignores individual differences in student behavior and motivation - fallacy of composition. not every student will use computers for non-educational purposes during class, so it is not accurate to say that computers always distract students.

step 3 (expert 3): lastly, the argument seems to be assuming that any use of technology during class time is necessarily a distraction - appeal to fear. this assumption does not take into account the potential educational benefits of using technology in the classroom, such as access to research materials or interactive learning tools. the fear of technology being a distraction should not overshadow the potential for it to enhance the educational experience.

answer: appeal to fear (combining the reasoning from all three experts)",False
591,Heavy Metal is just a genre.,nothing,"step 1: identification of argument structure
- argument structure: the argument seems to be making a claim about the nature of heavy metal, with no apparent counterargument or opposition presented.

step 2: analysis for fallacious reasoning
- no clear evidence of any fallacy in this statement as it stands. it is simply stating that heavy metal is a genre, not making an appeal, using fear, guilt, etc.

step 3: comparison to defined fallacies
- the statement does not match any of the defined fallacies presented.

answer: nothing",True
592,"The animals are a part of nature like us, and we, as humans, occupy their natural places. To not harm them any further, they should have special rights.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)

step 1: the statement attempts to make the argument seem reasonable by appealing to a positive direction, in this case, the emotion of compassion towards animals and the desire to preserve nature. however, it does not provide substantial evidence in favor of the action.

step 2: although the statement presents a valid concern for animal rights and preservation of nature, it does not logically follow that granting special rights to animals is an appropriate solution without further discussion or justification.

step 3: the argument can be strengthened by providing evidence, such as data on the negative impact human activities have on wildlife, and presenting a well-reasoned case for why animals should have special rights, instead of relying solely on emotional appeals.

step 4: since no further steps lead to a different fallacy classification, the final answer is 'answer: appeal to positive emotion'.",False
593,"Yes, there is obviously a need for it. I've read that about 5 percent of all students have children. Students usually have to attend lectures and won't be home until 4 pm.",nothing,"step 1: appeal to tradition
explanation: the argument is based on the historical preference of students having to attend lectures and not being at home during the day, which is used as evidence that it should continue to be the norm, disregarding other possible solutions or alternative arrangements for student parents.

step 2: tu quoque
explanation: the argument assumes that because a certain percentage of students have children, it justifies the tradition of not accommodating them during lecture times, ignoring the fact that this may not be applicable to all students with children and that other solutions could be considered.

step 3: fallacy of division
explanation: the argument infers that because some students cannot attend lectures at certain times due to childcare responsibilities, it means all student parents cannot attend at those times, thus reinforcing the tradition of not accommodating them during lecture times.

answer: tu quoque and fallacy of division",False
594,Christians should follow the rules of their religion.,nothing,"step 1: identify possible fallacies.
step 2: evaluate if the statement is an appeal to tradition.
answer: appeal to tradition",False
595,"No, the Scandinavian schools use another system and their students are the world's best. We are just average. It is not that effective.",nothing,"this statement seems to be using the fallacy of appeal to authority (false), as it suggests that because the scandinavian schools are considered the best in the world, their educational methods must be superior for any school or student. however, it ignores the complexities and variables involved in education, such as cultural differences, socioeconomic factors, and individual learning styles. this oversimplification results in a misrepresentation of the effectiveness of other schools' methods.

answer: appeal to (false) authority.",False
596,"A group that refuses any diplomatic way on problem-solving and uses weapons straight away cannot be defeated without being at level with them, even though the number of those operations should be kept as small as possible.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

step 1 (expert 1): the conclusion (the group cannot be defeated) is based on the premise that they refuse diplomatic ways and use weapons straight away, which implies that any other approach would not work, thus supporting the initial claim.

step 2 (expert 2): the assumption that any other approach would not work due to the group's behavior serves as the premise for the conclusion that they cannot be defeated without being at their level, forming a circle of reasoning with no new information added.

step 3 (expert 3): since the argument relies on its own premise to support its conclusion, this fits the definition of circular reasoning. no other fallacy is present in the statement.",False
597,Greece should leave the Eurozone because Europe needs to keep a responsible fiscal politics.,nothing,"step 1: initial observation (all experts)
- the argument proposes that greece should leave the eurozone due to the need for europe to maintain a responsible fiscal policy.

step 2: identification of potential fallacies (expert 1)
- determine if there is an appeal to fear, authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, or straw man in this argument.

step 3: analysis of potential fallacies (expert 2)
- analyze the given argument to determine if it exhibits any of these identified fallacies.

step 4: evaluation of the argument (expert 3)
- consider whether the argument is valid based on the available evidence and logical reasoning, regardless of the presence or absence of any identified fallacies.

final answer: answer: nothing. the argument does not appear to rely on any fallacies as described above, but it may still be evaluated for validity and soundness based on the available evidence and logical reasoning.",True
598,Nuclear power is an effective and reasonable energy source.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to authority
reasoning: the statement presents nuclear power as an effective and reasonable energy source, but does not provide evidence or reasoning for this claim beyond the assertion that experts say so. this is a form of appeal to authority fallacy since the argument relies on the opinion of an alleged expert without providing any actual evidence or reasons.

step 2: nothing
reasoning: since the statement does not present any other form of fallacious reasoning, we move on to the next step.

step 3: nothing
reasoning: the statement does not contain any other instances of fallacious reasoning.

599,"Yes, humans are not only mainly responsible for all current environmental problems, but we are also directly affected. We face problems like natural catastrophes, destruction of farmland, destruction of inhabitable areas, and loss of resources.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion

1st expert: the statement seems to be trying to evoke an emotional response in the reader about the environmental issues, rather than providing evidence or facts to support the claim that humans are mainly responsible for these problems.

2nd expert: yes, but it also emphasizes the negative effects of these environmental problems on humans, which could be seen as an attempt to manipulate the emotions of the readers and make them feel guilty or concerned about the state of the environment.

3rd expert: agreed. the statement is attempting to use our positive emotions towards preserving the environment (and potentially avoiding guilt) as a justification for its claim that humans are responsible for environmental problems, without providing any supporting evidence.",False
600,We should use animals as it is necessary to test.,nothing,"initial thoughts: the statement seems to suggest that animal testing is necessary. however, the reasoning behind this claim is not provided, and there's no evidence given to support the necessity of such testing.

second thoughts: the statement might be using an appeal to emotion by implying that not testing on animals could have negative consequences, such as harm or deaths in humans due to lack of research.

final answer: appeal to emotion",False
601,It will reduce crime.,nothing,"answer: appeal to fear

step 1: identify if the argument is trying to scare people into accepting a certain conclusion without providing evidence or reasoning.
step 2: in this case, it appears that the argument is suggesting that not taking action (i.e., not reducing crime) will lead to dire consequences (a rise in crime). however, there is no justification or evidence provided to support this claim.
step 3: the fact that people might be afraid of a potential increase in crime is being used as the primary motivator for accepting the conclusion, which is a fallacy known as 'appeal to fear'.",False
602,You should test athletes.,nothing,"step 1: identification of the argument structure.
- the statement suggests that a certain action (testing athletes) is justified based on an implied consequence (improvement or some other benefit).

step 2: determination of the reasoning used in the argument.
- the argument appears to use an appeal to positive emotion, as it tries to make the action seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion (improvement or some other benefit) rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.

answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
603,"Yes, before the incidents in Cologne, no newspaper reported crimes from refugees. I don't think that before this date no crimes from refugees were committed.",nothing,answer: appeal to tradition,False
604,"Yes, they have a positive impact, because you are much more connected to others than you were earlier. More communication means better understanding of others. And better understanding leads to a more peaceful society.",nothing,"answer: appeal to positive emotion. the argument is attempting to make the conclusion appear reasonable by appealing to the position emotion (being more connected and having a more peaceful society), rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.",False
605,"We need animal testing, even though it is horrible for the animals.",nothing,"step 1: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to negative emotion)
reasoning: the argument uses the emotional response of horror towards animal testing to justify the practice, rather than providing factual evidence or logical reasoning.

step 2: tu quoque
reasoning: the arguer is using their own discomfort with the situation as a justification for the practice, which is irrelevant to its validity.

step 3: nothing (since experts have reached a final agreement)
answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to negative emotion), tu quoque",True
606,"I am glad that you are able to dance your name, but please don't try to make every other child a softy as well.",nothing,"step 1: equivocation
explanation: the term ""dance"" is being used in an ambiguous way, as it can refer to various types of movement or performance, not just dancing one's name literally.

step 2: appeal to positive emotion
explanation: the speaker attempts to manipulate emotions positively to make the argument seem reasonable by expressing concern for other children. however, this emotion-based appeal does not provide substantial evidence in favor of the argument.

step 3: nothing
no further steps are needed as the initial classification was equivocation and the subsequent reasoning provided further support for this classification.

answer: equivocation",True
607,"If you look at the history, you will see that humanity has already tried a lot of different political systems. Democracy has always been the one where people were the happiest. Therefore, I say, yes.",nothing,answer: appeal to tradition,False
608,Many other countries already allow it.,nothing,answer: appeal to tradition,False
609,I'm basically against single-sex education.,nothing,"step 1: initial observation - the statement presents a position on single-sex education.

step 2: identifying possible fallacies - checking if fear, anger, tradition, or other emotional appeals are used to support the position.

step 3: no emotional appeal is evident in the statement.

step 4: checking for a straw man argument - comparing the actual argument presented with the position on single-sex education and assessing if it is distorted or misrepresented.

step 5: no straw man fallacy is present.

step 6: evaluating the use of tradition as an argument - assessing if historical preferences are being used to support the position on single-sex education.

step 7: no reference to tradition is made in the statement.

step 8: identifying equivocation - checking for ambiguous terms that might lead to a misleading argument regarding single-sex education.

step 9: the term ""against"" can be interpreted as opposing single-sex education, but there's no other ambiguity in the statement.

step 10: analysis of circular reasoning - checking if the position on single-sex education is supported by premises that rely on the proposition itself.

step 11: no circular reasoning is present.

since no fallacy has been identified, the final answer is 'answer: nothing'.",True
610,Animal testing can have serious impacts on researching new technologies for curing diseases in humans.,nothing,"step 1: identifying potential fallacies - appeal to emotion (in this case, appealing to sympathy or pity)

step 2: analyzing the statement - the argument is attempting to manipulate emotions by presenting an emotional appeal (the suffering of animals in testing) to justify a conclusion (that animal testing is necessary for research).

step 3: comparing with defined fallacies - this technique is similar to the ""appeal to pity"" fallacy, as it attempts to evoke sympathy or pity to sway opinion rather than provide evidence-based reasoning.

answer: appeal to pity",False
611,"If my daughters can be in an environment that celebrates girls as intelligent, creative individuals, without the boy craziness, then I will take it.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)
explanation: the person is trying to make the argument apparently seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion (""if you buy this ticket, i’m sure you will be happy!"") rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.",False
612,Germany should deal with the criminal refugees there and not force them onto another country. Deal with your problems yourself.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to anger - the argument is based on emotions of anger rather than evidence or reason.
step 2 (expert 2): guilt by association - the arguer is comparing criminal refugees to other countries, suggesting that they are somehow responsible for these refugees' problems, which is a distorted and misleading comparison.
step 3 (expert 3): appeal to fear - by using the term ""criminal"" without providing evidence or context, the argument might be trying to scare people into accepting it, which can lead to uninformed decisions.
answer: appeal to anger, guilt by association, and appeal to fear.",False
613,"No, because they are near to human in terms of evolution and I would not want to be held in a zoo.",nothing,"answer: guilt by association fallacy.
step 1: identifying the use of an argument that equates the species being discussed (humans and other apes) with the act or treatment of animals in a zoo.
step 2: recognizing that the two subjects are not equivalent, as humans and apes have different characteristics, behaviors, and capacities beyond their physical resemblance.
step 3: acknowledging that the conclusion is based on an association between the species being human-like (a shared ancestor) and their potential treatment in a zoo, which is not logically sound or relevant to the argument.",False
614,"Yes, if musicians are paid they will be given loyalty for their music.",nothing,"step 1 (expert a): this statement uses an appeal to emotion fallacy. the argument is based on the assumption that people will feel loyal because of payment, rather than providing evidence or reason for why this would be true.

step 2 (expert b): however, it might not be fair to immediately label it as a fallacy if there is some empirical evidence showing a correlation between payment and loyalty in musicians.

step 3 (expert a): in that case, we should examine the quality of the evidence presented, which in this hypothetical situation isn't given. without sufficient evidence to support the claim, it remains an appeal to emotion fallacy as the argument is still based primarily on emotion rather than reason or fact.

step 4 (expert b): if we assume that there exists strong empirical evidence supporting this relationship between payment and loyalty in musicians, then the statement would not be a fallacy. but since such evidence isn't provided here, it remains an appeal to emotion fallacy.

answer: appeal to emotion",False
615,We should allow it.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of appeal to tradition, as it implies that allowing something should be determined by historical precedent.

step 2 (expert 2): however, the word ""it"" is ambiguous and could refer to several things. if we assume ""it"" refers to a specific tradition, then we would need more context to confirm it as an appeal to tradition.

step 3 (expert 1): let's suppose the context makes clear that ""it"" indeed refers to a tradition regarding a certain practice or law. in that case, we can agree that this statement is an appeal to tradition since it suggests that historical precedent should dictate current decision-making.

step 4 (expert 2): but now let's consider the possibility that ""it"" does not refer to a tradition at all and instead refers to something entirely different, such as a policy or law. in that case, this statement would not be an appeal to tradition since there is no mention of historical precedent being relevant.

step 5 (expert 1): understood. in the event that ""it"" does refer to a tradition, we agree that this statement represents an appeal to tradition. if, however, it refers to something other than a tradition, then there is no clear fallacy present. so our final answer would be contingent upon the interpretation of ""it.""

answer: contingent upon the interpretation of ""it""",False
616,Adherents to a religion should follow the rules.,nothing,"initial thought: appeal to tradition

second thought: the argument is based on the historical practice of following religious rules, which could be interpreted as an appeal to tradition. however, the statement does not explicitly refer to the past or traditional practices, so it might not fit perfectly into this category.

third thought: guilt by association

fourth thought: since the argument is suggesting that adherents of a religion should follow the rules, the assumption seems to be that those who do not follow the rules are not 'true' adherents. this could be considered an appeal to guilt by association fallacy since it associates non-adherence to religious rules with being ""not a true"" adherent, without providing evidence for this association.

final answer: guilt by association",False
617,"Well in Germany this is not the case. The legal system works differently. The state prosecutor's main task is not to get you in jail, like it is in the USA. He has to investigate in both directions. That's why the process costs are less and that's why it is fair. Celebrities have the same chance as the average citizen.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the claim relies on its own premise (i.e., the state prosecutor's main task in germany is to investigate in both directions) to support its conclusion that the process costs are less and it is fair.

expert 2: the argument assumes that if a system investigates in both directions, then it will lead to a more fair outcome, but this assumption is not proven or demonstrated.

expert 3: the argument does not provide any evidence or reasoning as to why a system that investigates in both directions would result in lower costs and a fairer process. instead, the argument assumes that these outcomes are inherent in such a system. this is circular reasoning because the conclusion depends on the premise without independent support.",False
618,Every human has his right to choose what he wants.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be making a generalization about all humans, which may lead to the fallacy of hasty generalization if not based on sufficient evidence. however, without additional information it's hard to definitively say this is a fallacy.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement does not provide any justification or evidence for the claim that every human has the right to choose what they want. this could be an example of argument from ignorance or lack of evidence fallacy.

step 3 (expert 3): the statement does not include any specific consequences for not choosing what one wants, which could make it an appeal to fear fallacy if such consequences were implicitly implied. however, since no such consequences are stated explicitly, this doesn't seem like a clear example of the appeal to fear fallacy.

step 4 (expert 1 & expert 2): given that there is no explicit evidence provided for the claim and the generalization appears unsupported, we can agree that this statement may be an example of the argument from ignorance or lack of evidence fallacy.

answer: argument from ignorance or lack of evidence fallacy",False
619,"No, economic growth is a tool to establish a good economy, which allows us to live a good life. Growth for a good life, not life for economic growth.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)

expert 1: the statement seems to be trying to make the argument that economic growth is important because it leads to a better life. however, this reasoning seems to be based on the emotional appeal of wanting a good life, rather than providing any substantial evidence or logic for why economic growth specifically is necessary for this outcome.

expert 2: i agree with expert 1. the argument suggests that we should prioritize economic growth because it leads to a better life, but this connection seems to be based on the positive emotional connotation of having a good life rather than evidence or reasoning.

expert 3: yes, i see what you both mean. the statement seems to be making an emotional appeal to convince us that we should prioritize economic growth by promising a better life as a result. this is an example of the fallacy of appeal to positive emotion.",False
620,"Germany should help immigrants in need. Most of them left their homes not because of social or economic benefits, but because of the war.",nothing,"initial thoughts: this statement presents an argument for helping immigrants in need due to their situation being caused by a war. however, it also implies that all immigrants are refugees fleeing from war, which may not be the case.

step 1: equivocation - the term 'immigrant' is used ambiguously here; it could refer to anyone who migrates from one country to another, and not just refugees or asylum seekers.

step 2: nothing - as no other fallacy seems apparent in this statement after addressing the equivocation issue, the argument appears valid.

answer: nothing (equivocation addressed)",True
621,Greece needs to stay in the EU for unity of Europe.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this is an example of the ""appeal to emotion"" fallacy, because the argument uses the positive emotion of unity as a reason to justify staying in the eu, rather than providing substantial evidence or logical reasoning.

step 2 (expert 2): the argument also uses the ""appeal to tradition"" fallacy, since it implies that greece remaining in the eu is important for the historical precedent and continuity of europe's unity.

step 3 (expert 3): however, neither expert 1 nor expert 2 has considered the possibility that there may be valid logical or factual reasons for greece to remain in the eu apart from emotions and tradition. in this case, we should continue our discussion to determine whether the argument is indeed fallacious or not.

step 4 (expert 1): upon further investigation, if it is found that greece's continued membership in the eu serves a logical purpose such as maintaining economic stability or regional security, then the original statement would not be considered a fallacy. but if it is found that the statement relies solely on emotions and tradition without any substantiating evidence, then the argument can still be classified as ""appeal to emotion"" and ""appeal to tradition"" fallacies.

final answer: answer: appeal to emotion and appeal to tradition (if the argument lacks logical or factual reasons for greece's continued membership in the eu)",False
622,"Plastic surgery is very important, many people who got involved in severe accidents will tell you this. Think about victims of flames. Their bodies are often unrecognizably destroyed. Plastic surgery gives them their lives back.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to pity)

1st expert: the argument is focusing on the emotional impact of plastic surgery on accident victims rather than providing evidence or facts about its importance.
2nd expert: the argument is trying to manipulate our emotions by describing the tragic situations of accident victims to make us feel sympathetic towards plastic surgery.
3rd expert: the conclusion that plastic surgery is very important is not supported by any evidence or reasoning, but rather by an emotional response.",False
623,"The strike is not justified, because the DP-workers work less than the average German worker but are paid average. Their conditions are okay.",nothing,"initial classification: appeal to tradition

second classification: fallacy of division (the argument infers that something is true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole)

third classification: nothing (since the argument compares the strike workers with an average german worker, which is not a tradition but a comparison and does not imply that their conditions are okay)

final answer: fallacy of division",True
624,School detention does more harm than good.,nothing,"initial thought: the argument seems to be making a claim about the negative effects of school detention, but it doesn't provide any evidence or reasons to support that claim.

second thought: this can be classified as an appeal to emotion fallacy because the argument is trying to make the reader feel negatively towards school detention without providing any substantial evidence or reasoning.

third thought: if another expert argues that it's actually an example of an appeal to fear fallacy, as the statement might suggest that the fear of negative consequences (detention) can be overgeneralized as harm, we can agree that there is indeed a level of fear being invoked in this argument. however, since the main motivation for accepting the claim appears to be emotional response rather than evidence or reason, our initial conclusion still stands: 'answer: appeal to emotion'.

fourth thought: another expert might argue that this statement is just stating an opinion without any supporting evidence, but that doesn't necessarily make it a fallacy. however, since we have agreed that the primary motivation for accepting this claim is emotional response rather than evidence or reason, our initial conclusion still stands: 'answer: appeal to emotion'.

fifth thought: another expert might argue that this statement could also be classified as a straw man fallacy, as it presents school detention as inherently harmful without acknowledging the potential positive effects it may have. however, since the main focus of our analysis is on the argument's emotional manipulation rather than its misrepresentation of the other side's position, we can agree that this interpretation is less relevant to our initial conclusion: 'answer: appeal to emotion'.

final thought: since all experts have agreed that the primary motivation for accepting this claim appears to be an emotional response rather than evidence or reason, and no new arguments or interpretations have been presented, we can conclude that 'answer: appeal to emotion' is the final answer.",False
625,You should try to talk to your opponents - reasonable discussions and knowing why there is a clash of ideas is hard but gets you further than a simple brute force (= war).,nothing,"'answer: circular reasoning'

reasoning step 1: the statement suggests that discussing with opponents can lead to a solution, but the solution lies in having reasonable discussions.
reasoning step 2: if the solution is reasonable discussions, then the statement must be using that solution (reasonable discussions) as evidence for itself.
reasoning step 3: this creates a circle in reasoning, where the conclusion relies on its own premise, creating no new information or useful argument.",False
626,Letting everyone vote is a bad idea.,nothing,"step 1: identifying the structure of the argument.
- the argument suggests that an action (letting everyone vote) is bad without providing any evidence or reasoning.

step 2: recognizing a missing step in the argument.
- the argument does not explain why letting everyone vote is a bad idea; it simply asserts it as a fact without justification.

step 3: identifying the fallacy.
- the structure of the argument is lacking evidence or reasoning, which can be classified as an 'appeal to unstated premises' (also known as begging the question or circular reasoning, depending on the specifics of the argument). however, since the actual missing step is not provided, it cannot be accurately determined whether this is an instance of appeal to unstated premises or another fallacy entirely.
- as a group, we cannot come to a final agreement with the information given, as there are still missing steps in the argument that need to be addressed.

answer: nothing (more information required)",True
627,Of course not.,nothing,"experts 1: this statement presents a false dichotomy, implying that one must either believe in god or not believe in god. there is also the possibility of agnosticism, which suggests that one neither knows nor believes whether god exists. (appeal to false dichotomy)

experts 2: the argument uses fear as the primary motivator without providing evidence or reason for the fear-induced conclusion. this is an example of the fallacy known as appeal to fear.

experts 3: the argument attempts to establish a claim using an authority that may not be relevant, credible, or knowledgeable on the topic. this is the fallacy of appeal to (false) authority.

experts 1 & 2: both examples presented by experts 1 and 2 highlight different aspects of the same fallacy: in this case, it is a combination of false dichotomy (limiting the options to two extremes without acknowledging other possibilities) and appeal to fear (using emotional manipulation to sway opinion).

experts 3: the argument compares a given situation with the worst possible scenario to make the scenario seem less bad or unimportant, which is an example of the fallacy known as appeal to worse problems.

answer: appeal to false dichotomy and appeal to fear",False
628,Economical growth should not be the main goal of a country.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be an argument against a specific perspective or goal, in this case, economic growth being the main goal of a country. however, it does not provide any alternative goal or reason as to why economic growth should not be the main focus. therefore, this could be considered an appeal to fear, as the fear of negative consequences from economic growth might lead people to accept the argument without questioning it.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement doesn't explicitly state that there are no circumstances in which economic growth should be a goal, but instead presents it as an absolute truth. this is circular reasoning because the argument's validity relies on its own premise, i.e., that economic growth should not be the main goal of a country.

step 3 (expert 3): the statement does not provide any evidence or reasons to support why economic growth should not be the main goal, making it a claim without justification. this is an example of argument from ignorance.

conclusion: all three experts agree that the statement exhibits circular reasoning as the primary fallacy, with additional instances of appeal to fear and argument from ignorance. answer: circular reasoning",False
629,Drug testing is justified as it is necessary to create a fair and competitive environment.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)
step 2: drug testing can still be evaluated for necessity and its effectiveness in creating a fair and competitive environment without relying on the emotional appeal of positivity.
step 3: it is possible that drug testing has not been proven to actually create a fair and competitive environment.
step 4: without substantial evidence supporting the claim that drug testing creates a fair and competitive environment, the argument is not justified solely based on emotion.
answer: nothing (since the statement does not contain any logical fallacy as defined above)",True
630,Apple must pay the royalties for the streaming trial. The musicians don't ask for free iPhones either.,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

1st expert: the argument seems to be self-reinforcing as it uses the claim (musicians not asking for free iphones) to support itself, which could be classified as circular reasoning.

2nd expert: the claim is based on an assumption that the musicians and royalties for streaming are connected, but no evidence or reason is provided to justify this assumption, which could also be seen as a fallacy. however, the argument seems to revolve around a circular pattern of reasoning, so it makes sense to focus on that first.

3rd expert: agrees with the second expert, noting that the premise of the argument assumes a connection between the musicians and royalties for streaming (without providing any evidence or reason) but also observes that the argument is self-reinforcing and does not offer any new information, supporting the classification of circular reasoning.

the final answer is: answer: circular reasoning",False
631,"Many people are superficial, and man as such is a social creature. So there is obviously a need for plastic surgeries.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)

step 1 - expert a: this argument tries to make the conclusion seem reasonable by appealing to the position of positive emotions, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.

step 2 - expert b: the statement does not provide any evidence or reason why plastic surgeries are needed because people are superficial and man is a social creature.

step 3 - expert c: the argument is trying to manipulate emotions by implying that getting plastic surgery will make someone happy, but this is irrelevant to the actual need for plastic surgery.

therefore, the final answer is 'answer: appeal to positive emotion'.",False
632,Censoring the media will allow a tyrant like Hitler to enact laws without following the constitution and no one will call him out on it (kind of like Pres Obama).,nothing,"answer: appeal to fear.

step 1 - recognizing the presence of an appeal.
the statement attempts to frighten people into agreeing with its conclusion by suggesting that a tyrant like hitler could enact unconstitutional laws if the media is censored and no one would call him out on it, similar to president obama (even though there is no evidence or reason to suggest this).

step 2 - identifying the nature of the appeal.
the fear being invoked in this argument is not based on evidence or reason but rather relies on the idea that people will be too afraid of a repeat of historical atrocities to question any actions taken by the government, resulting in them just accepting the conclusion without questioning its validity. this can be classified as an appeal to fear fallacy.",False
633,"Apple shouldn't pay musicians any royalties for the three-months trial, because they can get rich enough from concerts.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to tradition - the argument assumes that since apple has historically not paid royalties during free trials, it should continue to do so indefinitely.

step 2 (expert 2): fallacy of division - the assumption that because a company can get rich from concerts, they should not pay royalties is a fallacy as it assumes the two are directly related and that the company's finances operate under the same principles as an individual's.

step 3 (expert 3): nothing - after considering both previous arguments, it appears that there is no apparent fallacy in the statement itself, but it does seem to lack critical reasoning and evidence. the argument could be improved by taking into account other factors such as the cost of licensing music or the potential impact on the music industry as a whole during free trials.

answer: nothing (but the reasoning behind this answer suggests that the statement could benefit from more thorough analysis and critical thinking)",True
634,"TV programs are driven by commercial interest, not science or experts.",nothing,"the first expert might say: this appears to be an example of 'appeal to fear'. the argument is trying to scare people into believing that tv programs are driven by commercial interests instead of science or experts, without providing any evidence for this claim.

the second expert might say: however, if we look closer, the statement does not directly imply that there is no science or expertise involved in tv programming. it merely suggests that commercial interest plays a significant role. so it may also be an 'appeal to tradition' fallacy since the statement seems to assume that tv programs should only be driven by science and experts, as if that was always the case.

the third expert might say: if we consider the context of modern media, where commercial interests are often intertwined with content creation, it could also be seen as a misrepresentation or 'straw man fallacy'. the argument presents tv programs as being purely driven by commercial interest, ignoring the many cases where science and experts play important roles.

the final answer: answer: straw man fallacy (since the argument is misrepresenting tv programming as purely driven by commercial interests, while ignoring the role of science and expertise).",False
635,Plastic surgery is a crucial field of medicine.,nothing,"step 1: initial observation - the statement presents an assertion about the nature and importance of plastic surgery, categorizing it as a ""field of medicine"".

step 2: identification of potential fallacy - given that no explicit argument or evidence is provided to support this claim, we might suspect the use of an appeal to authority.

step 3: analysis of potential supporting arguments - if there are claims about the qualifications and expertise of plastic surgeons, it may indicate an attempt to use an appeal to authority as a justification for labeling plastic surgery as medicine.

step 4: verification of fallacy presence - since no actual evidence or argument is presented in support of the claim that plastic surgery is a crucial field of medicine, it can be concluded that the statement is using an appeal to authority (fallacious) to make its assertion seem more valid.

answer: appeal to authority",False
636,"If they are political refugees, we have a duty to help them.",nothing,"step 1: initial assessment
- expert 1: the statement seems to suggest a moral obligation based on the status of individuals (political refugees).

step 2: identify potential fallacies
- expert 2: i notice an appeal to emotion, as the statement is trying to elicit sympathy or pity for political refugees.

step 3: evaluate argument structure
- expert 3: the argument does not seem to provide any reasoning or evidence to support the claim of a duty to help political refugees.

answer: appeal to pity",False
637,"Really, nobody has the right to tell me what I can do at my home!",nothing,"initial step by expert 1: this statement appears to be an appeal to anger. the argument is based on the arguer's emotion of anger instead of facts or evidence.

initial step by expert 2: however, it seems that this isn't a simple appeal to anger as there might be some underlying fact or reason that makes the arguer angry.

initial step by expert 3: in this case, the arguer is expressing their frustration about being told what to do at home, which could potentially be related to a violation of personal boundaries or privacy. however, we cannot confirm whether there was a specific instance of such violation without more context.

final answer: nothing (at this point, it seems that more information is needed to classify this statement as a fallacy)",True
638,It is the only way to get reliable results.,nothing,"initial thoughts: the given statement seems to be an example of the fallacy known as ""guilt by association."" however, let's consider this scenario with three experts:

expert 1: the statement suggests that because person a and b share a common belief or characteristic (in this case, not believing in god), they might have similar qualities or behaviors. this is a generalization based on one aspect of their identity without considering other factors, which can be seen as the fallacy of hasty generalization.

expert 2: the statement also implies that not believing in god places one into a specific category (either ""with"" or ""against"" god). however, it disregards the possibility of individuals having nuanced perspectives or questioning the concept of god altogether, which can be seen as an oversimplification.

expert 3: upon examining the statement, it becomes clear that the example provided (you are either with god or against him) creates a false dichotomy by limiting the spectrum of beliefs to two extremes when there are indeed other possibilities in between. this is the fallacy known as ""false dilemma"" or ""fallacy of false choice.""

upon discussion, all experts agree that the statement exhibits a 'false dilemma' fallacy because it presents a limited set of options (two extremes) when there are other possible choices in between.

answer: false dilemma",False
639,Yes. Criminals are a danger to Germany's society.,nothing,"answer: appeal to fear

1. statement presents a scenario that is frightening enough for many people (criminals are a danger to society)
2. this scenario is used as the primary motivator to accept the conclusion without questioning it (therefore, we need to be cautious about criminals)
3. no evidence or reason is provided for the claim that criminals pose a significant threat to germany's society",False
640,Countries shouldn't adopt heavier penalties for drug use.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this argument could be an example of 'appeal to emotion' because it suggests that countries should not adopt heavier penalties for drug use based on the negative emotional response to such penalties rather than evidence or reason.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it is important to note that the statement does not directly appeal to emotions but rather implies a negative consequence of heavier penalties, which can still be considered an 'appeal to fear'.

step 3 (expert 3): although the argument may still evoke emotions related to empathy towards drug users, it is also attempting to present an argument based on potential problems that could arise from stricter penalties. thus, it might be more accurately classified as 'appeal to worse problems'.

answer: appeal to worse problems",False
641,Disallowing people from Ebola infected countries to enter another country is against human rights.,nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion

1st step: the statement makes an emotional argument by appealing to the idea of human rights, which can evoke strong feelings and sympathy in readers or listeners.
2nd step: however, this does not necessarily make the action of disallowing people from ebola infected countries to enter another country wrong. the claim needs to be evaluated based on evidence, facts, and relevant laws, not just emotional appeals.",False
642,Flying cars will become reality someday.,nothing,"step 1: circular reasoning (if flying cars are real, they will become reality; therefore, they will become reality.)
step 2: appeal to tradition (cars have always been ground-based vehicles; therefore, flying cars will not be traditional.)
step 3: fallacy of division (the fact that some cars might fly does not mean all cars will fly.)
step 4: nothing (since the argument does not rely on fear, false authority, worse problems, guilt by association, appeal to anger, straw man fallacy, appeal to tradition, equivocation, or appeal to positive emotion, no further classification is necessary.)
answer: nothing",True
643,"Yes, Jesus has almost never used force. Just once to chase away some merchants. He preached of love and forgiveness. The religion builds upon his teachings, so yes, it is peaceful.",nothing,"answer: nothing

expert 1: the statement does not explicitly provide an argument or conclusion, only a description.

expert 2: there's no premise presented for evaluation in the given statement.

expert 3: agreed with expert 1 and expert 2 that there is no fallacy present as the statement doesn't contain an argument or a conclusion being argued.",True
644,There are more gorillas raised in zoos and re-introduced into the wild than captured and kept.,nothing,"step 1: initial observation of the statement - nothing identified as a specific fallacy.

step 2: analysis of the statement for potential fallacies - recognizing that the statement is making a comparison between two groups (gorillas raised in zoos and re-introduced into the wild, and gorillas captured and kept).

step 3: determining if the comparison being made is relevant to the conclusion - in this case, the comparison seems to be relevant as it directly relates to the number of gorillas that are in a given state (either raised/re-introduced or captured/kept).

step 4: evaluating whether any fallacies have been committed in the comparison - upon closer examination, it appears that no fallacies have been committed as the comparison is presented in a straightforward manner without exaggeration, distortion, or misrepresentation.

final answer: nothing (no specific fallacy identified)",True
645,"That is true. However, we cannot be sure others will be responsible.",nothing,"answer: appeal to fear
explanation: the statement is trying to instill fear in people (in this case, that others might not be responsible) as a primary motivator for accepting the conclusion, without providing evidence or reason to support this fear. this is an appeal to fear fallacy.",False
646,Censorship helps protect children.,nothing,"step 1 (expert a): this statement seems to be an example of ""appeal to emotion"". the argument is being presented in a way that aims to evoke an emotional response rather than providing evidence or reason for the claim.

step 2 (expert b): however, it could also be classified as a form of ""appeal to fear"" if the implication is that without censorship, children will be exposed to harmful content that might negatively impact them.

step 3 (expert c): upon further consideration, both classifications can apply since the statement aims to appeal to emotional concerns about child protection while simultaneously using fear as a motivator for accepting the conclusion that censorship is needed.

answer: appeal to emotion and appeal to fear",False
647,"With the actual milk price, the cows can be appropriately held, and the farmers can still achieve some earnings.",nothing,"step 1: appeal to consequences (also known as ""appeal to consequences"" or ""appeal to self-interest"") - the argument suggests that if the farmers maintain the cows with the current milk price, they will still have earnings. this is an appeal to the positive outcome of keeping the cows, rather than providing evidence for the claim itself.

step 2: none of the experts finds any other fallacy in this statement.

answer: appeal to consequences (or ""appeal to self-interest"")",False
648,"Yes, homeschooling, everyone.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): the statement suggests that there is only one choice for a parent in terms of their child's education: either they send the child to school or educate them at home. this may be an oversimplification as there are various forms of hybrid learning and other educational options available.
step 2 (expert 2): the statement also implies that homeschooling is an absolute solution for every family, which contradicts the fact that each family's situation and needs can be different.
step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, the statement does not provide any evidence to support the claim that homeschooling yields better academic or personal development outcomes than traditional schooling for all children in all situations.
answer: appeal to simplicity (oversimplification) and false authority (implied effectiveness of homeschooling without providing evidence)",False
649,I think Titanic deserves 11 Oscars at once.,nothing,"the experts would first agree that this statement is an example of an argument, and then proceed to analyze it for potential fallacies.

in the first step, one expert might identify the use of emotional manipulation as a strategy to make the argument seem reasonable: 'appeal to positive emotion'.

the next expert, building upon the previous point, would note that the argument's conclusion (titanic deserves 11 oscars at once) is not supported by any evidence or reasoning but relies solely on emotional appeal: 'argument from emotion'.

in the final step, the remaining experts would combine these observations to reach a consensus on the primary fallacy present in the statement: 'answer: appeal to positive emotion'. while there may be other fallacies (such as lack of evidence or reasoning), the use of emotional manipulation is the most salient example.",False
650,"He killed, yes. But this does not mean that it is impossible to talk to him. If we can save lives by this way, we should do it.",nothing,"'answer: appeal to emotion'
step 1: the argument appeals to the emotion of saving lives as a reason to justify an action, rather than providing substantial evidence in favor of the action.
step 2: the statement does not provide any evidence that talking to the killer will result in saving lives.
step 3: even if there was some possibility that talking to the killer could save lives, it is important to consider other ethical and practical implications before taking such an action.
step 4: there is no justification for disregarding these concerns simply because it might result in a positive outcome (saving lives).
step 5: the argument is based solely on emotion, and as such, does not provide a sound basis for the conclusion that we should talk to the killer.",False
651,The current grading system just fails.,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

step 1 (first expert): the conclusion, that ""the answer is circular reasoning"", is based on the premise that ""the current grading system just fails"". however, this very same premise about the failure of the grading system is used as evidence to support the conclusion. this creates a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared.

step 2 (second expert): the claim that the grading system fails is presented as an absolute truth without any justification or supporting evidence, making it a premise without justification.

step 3 (third expert): upon further examination of the argument, it becomes clear that there is no other reasonable explanation for the statement other than circular reasoning. therefore, the final answer is ""answer: circular reasoning"". all experts agree.",False
652,Democracy is peaceful.,nothing,"initial thought: the statement seems to present a positive claim about democracy, but there is no clear evidence or argument provided to support it. it could be seen as an appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion) because it assumes that peacefulness is something positive and desirable, which may influence people to accept the claim without questioning it. however, more information or reasoning is needed to confirm this as a fallacy.

second thought: the statement does not provide any comparison or contrast with other systems of government to demonstrate that democracy is indeed peaceful. this might lead to circular reasoning since we are assuming that democracy is peaceful because it is called ""democracy"" and the definition of democracy includes peacefulness.

third thought: the statement seems to be making a broad generalization about all instances of democracy without considering any exceptions or qualifications. this could potentially be an example of the fallacy of division, as the claim that ""all democracies are peaceful"" is being made based on the assumption that characteristics of one part (peacefulness) apply to the whole (democracy).

fourth thought: the statement does not seem to contain any fear-based appeals or arguments from false authority. there is also no comparison with worse problems, guilt by association, straw man fallacy, equivocation, or tu quoque in this statement.

answer: nothing (as the statement does not appear to be a clear example of any identified fallacies.)",True
653,Adolescence is hard enough without having to try learning in an environment of hormone-laced competition and distraction.,nothing,"answer: appeal to emotions (appeal to pity)

expert 1: the arguer is trying to make the audience sympathize with them by describing their struggles, which may distract from the truth of the conclusion they want to draw about learning in school.

expert 2: however, it seems that the emotional appeal is being used specifically to persuade the professor to change the student's grade, rather than justifying a broader argument or policy about education.

expert 3: therefore, this can be classified as an attempt to distract from the truth of the conclusion by using pity, which is known as 'appeal to pity'.",False
654,"The technical expertise is there, having space ships, airplanes etc., and sooner or later humans have always used technology to their advantage and to make things more comfortable/easier for them.",nothing,"answer: appeal to tradition

expert 1: the use of technology has always been a part of human history.

expert 2: they are arguing that because we have done it in the past, we should continue to do so in the present.

expert 3: this argument does not provide a justification for using technology today based on its historical use. it is merely an appeal to tradition without evidence supporting the claim that technology is still necessary or beneficial in current times.",False
655,Same-sex couples should have access to the same benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement is not an appeal to fear, as it does not use fear to motivate acceptance of the idea.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement also does not commit the fallacy of guilt by association, as there is no negative connotation associated with being in a same-sex relationship that would make them 'bad'.

step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, the argument does not rely on anger or emotions to be accepted, nor does it use false authority. it also does not equivocate any terms, commit circular reasoning, or appeal to tradition.

step 4 (expert 1): the statement is not making worse problems by comparing them to something else, nor is it a straw man fallacy, as the argument made is directly addressing same-sex couples' access to benefits and not misrepresenting their position.

step 5 (expert 2): lastly, the argument does not use positive emotions to manipulate, nor does it employ any form of tu quoque or appeal to pity.

answer: nothing",True
656,"Alle, die hier leben sollten auch involviert sein, wenn es darum geht was hier in Zukunft passiert. (Everyone living here should also be involved when it comes to deciding what happens here in the future.)",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion
explanation: the statement is trying to manipulate emotions to make people feel involved and agreeable, rather than providing logical or reasonable evidence for why they should be involved.",False
657,"Smoking at home is dangerous, as exactly as eating cheese at home or walking up and down stairs. There is no explicit reason to make it illegal.",nothing,"this statement appears to commit the fallacy of equivocation. the term ""dangerous"" is being used in two different senses. in the first instance, smoking at home can be dangerous due to health risks, but eating cheese or walking up and down stairs are not inherently dangerous in the same way. in the second instance, making something illegal because it is dangerous implies a level of threat or risk that warrants government intervention, which might not be the case for smoking at home compared to other activities mentioned. therefore, the argument uses the ambiguous term ""dangerous"" in two different ways, leading to a fallacious conclusion.

final answer: equivocation",False
658,Microsoft can't be the new Apple. Apple focuses on innovative design. Microsoft focuses on software for productivity and products that don't have to be innovative in design.,nothing,"answer: appeal to false authority

expert 1: the claim that only a company focused on innovative design is like apple, while a company focused on productivity and functional design is not, implies that there is an established authority on what defines apple. however, this supposed authority has not been provided.

expert 2: the claim assumes that innovation in design and productivity are mutually exclusive for companies, which is false as many companies can excel in both areas.

expert 3: since it is shown that the assumption of innovation and productivity being mutually exclusive is incorrect, there is no fallacy present in this statement. however, the claim made about microsoft not being like apple because of its focus on software for productivity relies on the unstated premise that a company cannot be both innovative and productive, which has been disproven by numerous examples. therefore, the statement can be seen as an appeal to false authority by implying that a certain perspective or idea is true simply because it is associated with apple's success, despite not providing evidence or justification for this claim.",False
659,"Some shows on TV serve educational purposes, but most of them are totally worthless. There is no chance that a mind of a child builds up, when it watches Celebrity-news.",nothing,"answer: appeal to fear

1st expert: the statement uses the idea of a ""mind of a child building up"" as something bad if not educated, which could be frightening for some people who value education and worry about the well-being of children. however, there is no evidence provided that watching celebrity news will harm a child's development.

2nd expert: the argument also ignores the possibility that some educational shows on tv may not be engaging or interesting to certain children, whereas celebrity news might provide entertainment and spark curiosity in other aspects of society.

3rd expert: furthermore, the conclusion is based solely on the assumption that all celebrity-news shows are worthless, without considering exceptions or individual instances where such content may have some educational value.

the final agreement is 'answer: appeal to fear' since the argument attempts to scare people into believing that watching celebrity news will harm children's development, despite a lack of evidence supporting this claim.",False
660,"Yes, companies are already working on creating cars which are able to fly quite successfully. Thus, flying cars will become reality in the near future.",nothing,"'answer: appeal to positive emotion'

step 1 (expert 1): the statement is making a conclusion about the future without providing any evidence or reasoning for why this is true.

step 2 (expert 2): additionally, the statement is appealing to a positive emotion (the idea of flying cars sounding exciting) as the primary motivator for accepting its conclusion, rather than presenting objective facts or evidence.

step 3 (expert 3): confirmation: the expert agrees with the reasoning and identifies the fallacy as an 'appeal to positive emotion'.",False
661,"Yes, school uniforms do create a better learning environment.",nothing,"step 1: initial argument analysis (identifying the structure of the argument)
- argument is presented as a cause and effect statement, suggesting that school uniforms lead to a better learning environment.

step 2: analyzing the claim (assessing whether the claim is supported by evidence or reasoning)
- there's no mention of specific evidence or reasoning provided to support the claim that school uniforms create a better learning environment.

step 3: identifying potential fallacies (determining if the argument relies on any fallacious reasoning)
- since there's no evidence or reasoning presented, we cannot definitively say this is a specific fallacy. however, it might be considered a weak argument as it lacks supporting evidence.

final answer: nothing (this argument can be classified as lacking evidential support rather than a specific fallacy as defined in the examples provided.)",True
662,Home school provides a better education than underfunded public schools.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to tradition
the argument is based on the assumption that home schooling has been traditionally considered superior, and therefore it should be the case for underfunded public schools as well. however, this does not take into account current educational research or teaching methodologies in both settings.

step 2: equivocation
the term ""better"" is ambiguous since it can refer to various aspects of education such as individual attention, curriculum design, resources, etc. the argument assumes that ""better"" refers solely to the quality of education provided, but this might not necessarily be the case for all individuals and circumstances.

step 3: nothing
the statement does not commit any other fallacies described above. however, it is essential to point out that the statement lacks evidence to support its claim. the comparison between home schooling and underfunded public schools requires data-driven analysis rather than assumptions based on tradition or equivocation.

final answer: nothing",True
663,Alternative energy resources are too expensive.,nothing,"step 1: initial observation - the statement appears to be an appeal to cost, where the argument is based on the assumption that because something is expensive, it should not be used or pursued.

step 2: comparison with known fallacies - this situation does not appear to fit perfectly into any of the previously defined fallacies. however, it shares characteristics with the 'appeal to consequences' fallacy, where a negative consequence (expense in this case) is used to support an argument without considering other factors or alternatives.

step 3: identifying distinct elements - while there are no specific examples provided for comparison, the statement can be broken down into two key parts: the assumption that all alternative energy resources are expensive and the conclusion that they should not be pursued based on this expense.

step 4: determining the reasoning - the reasoning here appears to be a simplistic cost-benefit analysis where the only cost considered is the upfront expense of the alternative energy resource, without weighing its potential long-term benefits or exploring other viable options.

step 5: comparison with known fallacies (revised) - given that this reasoning is based on an incomplete cost-benefit analysis, it can be categorized as a form of the 'appeal to consequences' fallacy, where a single negative consequence (expense) is used to support an argument without considering other factors or alternatives.

step 6: final agreement - answer: appeal to consequences (incomplete cost-benefit analysis)",False
664,This would cause significant disadvantages for children from non-academic families.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be an example of ""appeal to emotion"" as the argument is trying to evoke feelings of sympathy or pity, which might lead people to accept the conclusion without proper consideration.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it could also be argued that this statement implies a comparison between academic and non-academic families, suggesting a form of ""appeal to tradition"" as it assumes that academic families are more conducive to academic success.

step 3 (expert 1): that is correct. the statement can be seen as both an appeal to emotion and an appeal to tradition. it tries to evoke sympathy while also making assumptions about the academic background of families.

answer: appeal to emotion, appeal to tradition",False
665,Animal testing for medical purposes should be allowed.,nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, an appeal to positive emotion)

1st expert: argument is based on the presumption that allowing animal testing for medical purposes will make people feel positively about it.
2nd expert: the argument does not provide any evidence or reason for why this is true, instead relying on emotional manipulation.
3rd expert: final conclusion agrees with previous two experts, the argument is an attempt to distract from the truth of the conclusion by using positive emotions to make the action seem reasonable.",False
666,Microsoft is the new apple.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be a form of equivocation, as the terms ""new"" and ""apple"" are being used in different ways than their standard definitions.
step 2 (expert 2): the comparison between microsoft and apple seems to be based on a false assumption that microsoft is an entirely new entity, which it is not.
step 3 (expert 3): additionally, there is no evidence provided to support the idea that microsoft has surpassed or replaced apple in any significant way, making this statement potentially an appeal to false authority as well.
answer: equivocation and appeal to false authority",False
667,"It is obvious that anyone has been on the moon. Meanwhile, 2015, there have been quite a lot expeditions to the moon. The newer ones were even livestreamed on Twitter and co. Don't tell me the government fakes livestreams.",nothing,"answer: appeal to authority (fallacy)

explanation step 1: the arguer is using the fact that multiple expeditions, including livestreamed ones, have gone to the moon as evidence for the claim that it is obvious anyone has been on the moon.

explanation step 2: however, this argument does not provide a justification for why we should believe that any human beings went to the moon. the fact that multiple expeditions have been made to the moon does not mean that someone actually stepped foot there.

explanation step 3: to prove that humans have been on the moon, one would need to provide evidence such as photos or artifacts brought back from the moon, as well as credible witnesses who can attest to this fact. without such evidence, the claim that it is obvious anyone has been on the moon remains unproven.",False
668,To find out if there is a reason for the American war on terror let's take a look at the results nearly one and a half decade later.,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the conclusion (the reason for the american war on terror) is being used to justify looking at its results, creating a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared.

expert 2: the premise here is that we should look at the results of the war on terror to find out the reason for it. however, this doesn't make any sense unless we already know why the war was started in the first place.

expert 3: the argument assumes that there must be a reason for the american war on terror and that finding the reason can only be done by looking at its results, which creates a circular logic.",False
669,Cellphones should be banned from classrooms.,nothing,"step 1: initial response (all experts agree)
-appeal to emotion
explanation: the statement is appealing to the emotional aspect of cellphone use in classrooms being disruptive, rather than providing evidence or reason for the claim that cellphones should be banned.

step 2: response to the first step
-nothing (two experts leave, agreeing with the initial response)
explanation: the ban on cellphones does not necessarily mean they are always disruptive, and there is no evidence provided to support this claim.

step 3: response to the second step
-fallacy of division
explanation: banning cellphones from classrooms infers that every phone being used in classrooms is a problem, which may not be true for all instances. the size of one’s part (the misbehaving students using their phones) does not mean the whole (all students using their phones) is a problem.

final answer: fallacy of division",True
670,It is best to home school our kids.,nothing,"step 1: initial thoughts
- expert a: the statement appears to make a claim about the superiority of home schooling over traditional schooling, potentially using emotion as a motivator (appeal to positive emotion).
- expert b: the statement presents an opinion as fact, lacking evidence or logical reasoning (argument from ignorance).
- expert c: the statement assumes that home schooling is the best choice for every child without considering individual circumstances and needs (hasty generalization).

step 2: sharing insights with the group
- expert a: i think the statement is using emotional appeal to promote home schooling.
- expert b: there's no evidence provided to support the claim that home schooling is better than traditional schooling.
- expert c: the statement ignores the unique needs and circumstances of each child in favor of a blanket recommendation for home schooling.

step 3: building upon insights
- expert a: since we're considering fallacies, i think we can rule out appeal to pity since there is no mention of an emotional manipulation or suffering involved.
- expert b: we should also consider the possibility that this statement is a form of circular reasoning if the argument for home schooling is based on personal beliefs rather than factual evidence.
- expert c: let's discuss how this might be considered an appeal to tradition, as home schooling has been a popular trend in certain communities and cultures.

step 4: arriving at a final answer
- expert a: i believe the statement is an example of an appeal to positive emotion, as it tries to sway opinion by appealing to the positive aspect of home schooling.
- expert b: i agree with expert a that this is an appeal to positive emotion but would also suggest that the argument lacks logical reasoning and evidence (argument from ignorance).
- expert c: i concur with both experts a and b, and would add that it uses hasty generalization by not considering each child's unique needs and circumstances.

answer: appeal to positive emotion, argument from ignorance, hasty generalization",False
671,"It has to be balanced, but for life-saving drugs, it should be allowed on non-endangered animal species.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)

expert 1: the statement starts with a phrase ""for life-saving drugs"" which suggests the argument is about the necessity of saving lives. however, the rest of the sentence introduces an emotional element by implying happiness as a result of the action (buying the ticket). this could be an attempt to make the argument seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.

expert 2: the statement continues to imply that the action of buying the ticket will lead to happiness, which seems unjustified in this context and ignores any potential drawbacks or consequences associated with the action. this could be seen as an attempt to manipulate the emotions of the reader to agree with the argument without providing adequate evidence or reason.

expert 3: the statement does not provide any rational or logical reasons for why buying a ticket would lead to life-saving drugs being allowed on non-endangered animal species. instead, it relies solely on emotional manipulation through the promise of happiness. this can be classified as an appeal to positive emotion fallacy.",False
672,Animal testing helps to improve medical care for everybody.,nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion

step 1 (expert 1): the argument is trying to manipulate emotions to make the action of animal testing seem reasonable, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.

step 2 (expert 2): the argument does not provide any factual or logical reason for why medical care will be improved through animal testing.

step 3 (expert 3): the argument does not justify the use of animals in testing, and it is being used to manipulate emotions rather than provide evidence for its validity.",False
673,"They brought several kilos of moon rocks back to earth, and you cannot simply fake four billion years old rock material.",nothing,"answer: appeal to authority (fallacy)

expert 1: the argument uses the fact that experts brought the moon rocks as an evidence to support its claim that the moon rocks are not fakable. however, being experts in bringing moon rocks doesn't necessarily make them experts in determining whether or not the rocks can be faked.

expert 2: the argument assumes that if the experts were able to bring back genuine moon rocks, they must also have the authority on whether or not it is possible to fake the rock material. but this is an incorrect assumption as their expertise in one area does not translate to other areas.",False
674,"I don't think so, he lived too short in order to have the most influence. Dr. Dre for example had much more influence. He started the rap-movement with Eazy-E and Ice Cube. He just sold his headphone brand for around 250 million dollars. This amount of money shows how influential Dr. Dre is. Tupac never had this much money.",nothing,"answer: appeal to authority (false)

explanation step 1: the argument uses the financial success of dr. dre as evidence that he was more influential than tupac shakur, implying that financial success equals influence.
explanation step 2: however, financial success is not a valid measure of influence in music or any other field, as it can be influenced by many factors beyond the scope of artistic impact and influence.
explanation step 3: influence requires evidence based on recognition, cultural impact, and lasting legacy rather than financial success alone.
explanation step 4: tupac shakur's music continues to have a profound effect on popular culture and has influenced many artists long after his death, demonstrating his significant influence despite not having the same level of financial success as dr. dre.",False
675,Marijuana has been shown to be effective in treating glaucoma.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be making a claim about marijuana's effectiveness based on scientific evidence. however, it does not specify the source of this evidence, so i would classify it as 'appeal to unspecified authority'.

step 2 (expert 2): if the source of the evidence were specified and found to be credible, then the argument could potentially be valid. but if the source was found to lack scientific rigor or credibility, it would be an example of an 'appeal to false authority'.

step 3 (expert 3): without further information about the nature and quality of the evidence, i propose we assume that the evidence is not falsified and thus could potentially support the claim. therefore, if the source of the evidence turns out to be credible, the argument would be valid; otherwise, it would be an 'appeal to false authority'.

answer: if the source of the evidence supporting marijuana's effectiveness in treating glaucoma is found to be credible, then the argument would not be a fallacy. however, without such information, it could potentially be classified as an 'appeal to unspecified authority' or an 'appeal to false authority'.",False
676,That Marijuana should be legalized.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): the argument seems to be based on personal opinion rather than evidence or reasoning, suggesting a possible appeal to emotion fallacy.

step 2 (expert 2): however, the appeal to emotion is not necessarily a fallacy when discussing policy changes that have emotional implications. it becomes problematic if no other rationales are provided. let's continue searching for more information.

step 3 (expert 3): the argument does not present any evidence or facts, such as studies on the benefits and drawbacks of marijuana legalization, leaving it largely based on personal feelings. this could be seen as a lack of support for the conclusion, potentially making it an example of an appeal to emotion fallacy.

step 4 (expert 1): upon re-evaluation, we should consider that emotional arguments can sometimes serve as a starting point in policy discussions, but they must be backed up with evidence and reasoning to avoid falling into a fallacy. in this case, since the argument lacks such evidence, it could still be considered an example of an appeal to emotion fallacy.

step 5 (expert 2): while emotional arguments can play a role in policy discussions, they should not stand alone without additional rationales and supporting evidence. since our argument does not provide this, we agree that it could potentially be seen as an appeal to emotion fallacy.

answer: appeal to emotion",False
677,"Although any suffering of living creatures should be avoided, I guess it's commonly accepted by the society that medical purposes testing has more benefits than harms.",nothing,answer: appeal to tradition,False
678,"This programming language is open for everybody, so it encourages more developers to participate.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion

expert 1: this statement appeals to a positive emotion (enthusiasm) to encourage more people to participate in the programming language. the argument is not based on evidence or reason but rather an emotional response.

expert 2: the reasoning here is that appealing to emotions can create a sense of belonging and excitement, which might persuade more individuals to develop the programming language. however, this does not prove that the programming language is open for everyone nor does it demonstrate its quality.

expert 3: the argument seems to focus on creating an attractive environment for developers to participate in the programming language using positive emotions as a motivator. this can be considered an 'appeal to emotion' fallacy since it uses emotional responses rather than evidence or reason to support its claim.",False
679,Only a few countries contribute to the majority of pollution.,nothing,"the first expert might think: this statement seems to be implying that the minority of countries are responsible for less pollution, but it doesn't explicitly state that. it could be an example of equivocation fallacy since 'majority' and 'most' have slightly different meanings.

the second expert might think: the statement does not mention what percentage constitutes a majority. without knowing the exact percentage, it is hard to determine if the statement is accurate or not. this could be an example of circular reasoning if the definition of a majority was already assumed and used in the argument.

the third expert might think: upon careful examination of the statement, there's no indication that the argument relies on fear, tradition, anger, guilt by association, appeal to authority, worse problems, straw man, or appeal to positive emotion. the only remaining possible fallacy is either equivocation or circular reasoning.

since both experts find it difficult to determine if it's an equivocation or circular reasoning without knowing the exact percentage and the argument does not rely on any other fallacies, they might agree that 'answer: nothing'.",True
680,Renewable energy sources will not soon replace fossil fuels.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to tradition (using historical preference as evidence for a conclusion)
step 2: appeal to fear (fear of change, uncertainty about the future of energy supply and potential economic impact)
step 3: circular reasoning (the argument is based on the premise that renewable energy sources have not replaced fossil fuels yet, thus they will never replace them)
step 4: nothing (no further steps are necessary as a consensus has been reached)
answer: appeal to tradition, appeal to fear, circular reasoning.",True
681,"Well, Ebola is a disease and it makes sense to coordinate countries worldwide to fight against it. To me, global environmental task force sounds fuzzy without a clear purpose. We don't need such an organization.",nothing,answer: appeal to fear,False
682,Humans are to blame for some animal extinctions.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be making a cause and effect claim, so i would start by classifying it as an argument by causation.

step 2 (expert 2): however, the claim does not specify that humans intentionally caused these extinctions, so it seems more accurate to reclassify this as an argument from correlation, suggesting a possible link between human activity and animal extinction without establishing causality.

step 3 (expert 3): on further examination, i notice that the statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning for why humans are to blame. it merely makes the claim. therefore, this is an example of unsupported argument, where a conclusion is presented without providing adequate evidence or justification, making it difficult to evaluate its validity.

answer: unsupported argument",False
683,Yes. It will allow the mothers to go to school and help the children to grow up better.,nothing,"answer: appeal to emotions (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)
explanation step 1: the statement is trying to make the argument seem reasonable by appealing to a positive direction of the emotion rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.
explanation step 2: the use of ""help the children to grow up better"" does not provide any supporting evidence for the initial claim that going to school will help the children grow up better, but instead relies on the emotions of the reader/listener to accept it as true.",False

685,"In modern jobs, home office is already the standard, because the workers are more productive at home. Why shouldn't this be better for kids as well?",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to positive emotion - the argument attempts to make remote learning seem reasonable by appealing to the position emotion of increased productivity instead of giving substantial evidence in favor of the action.

step 2 (expert 2): nothing - there is no fear appeal, false authority, or worse problems fallacy present in this argument.

step 3 (expert 3): nothing - the argument does not use circular reasoning, guilt by association, straw man fallacy, or equivocation.

step 4: answer: appeal to positive emotion",True
686,Neuer is the best goalkeeper of the World Cup by far as he let very few balls slip by.,nothing,"initial classifications:

1. appeal to authority (the statement presents neuer as the best goalkeeper based on his own performance, implying he's an authoritative source)
2. circular reasoning (the argument supports itself by stating that since neuer let few balls slip by, he's the best; this is an unproven claim)
3. no fallacy identified yet (waiting for other experts to share their thoughts)

687,Kids need to go to a proper school and home schooling harms them.,nothing,"initial thought: appeal to tradition (as it argues that because something has been done in the past, it should continue to be done)

second thought: fallacy of division (as the argument infers that because going to a proper school is good for all children, home-schooling must be harmful)

third thought: nothing (no other fallacies seem to be present)

final answer: answer: fallacy of division",True
688,Decreasing the price will increase the demand.,nothing,"initial step (expert 1): this statement appears to be an argument based on cause and effect, but it might not be logically sound because lowering prices does not necessarily guarantee an increased demand if there are other factors affecting consumer behavior, such as perceived value or quality of the product.

initial step (expert 2): however, decreasing the price can create a situation where more people may choose to purchase the item due to affordability, increasing the demand in a direct sense.

final step (expert 3): although lowering prices may cause an increase in demand in some cases, it does not always guarantee a proportional increase because other factors such as income levels, preferences, and perceived value play important roles in determining overall demand.

answer: fallacy of division",False
689,Athletes definitely should be drug tested!,nothing,"step 1: identify the argument being made.
argument: athletes should be drug tested.

step 2: identify the fallacy category.
the argument does not seem to use any of the specific fallacies listed (fear, authority, worse problems, circular reasoning, guilt by association, anger, straw man, tradition, equivocation, division, tu quoque, positive emotion, pity). instead, it seems more like a statement of fact or opinion. however, the lack of evidence provided to support this claim could potentially be considered as an informal fallacy known as ""burden of proof"" - the argument assumes that drug testing is necessary without providing any justification or evidence for why this is so.

step 3: compare and contrast with other possible arguments that fit into the same category.
similar examples of burden of proof fallacies include claiming that aliens exist because there's no evidence to prove they don't, or asserting that vaccines cause autism without providing any scientific evidence.

step 4: reach a final agreement among experts.
the experts agree that the argument is an example of the burden of proof fallacy.

answer: burden of proof",False
690,The EU would be better adapting so that Greece is able to function well while staying in the country.,nothing,"answer: appeal to worse problems

step 1 (expert 1): the statement implies that there are only two options for greece - either struggling within the eu or being outside of it.

step 2 (expert 2): the argument suggests that if greece stays in the eu, it will be able to function well, implying that leaving the eu would mean worse problems for greece.

step 3 (expert 3): this reasoning uses the worst case scenario as a way to make staying in the eu seem better, which is an appeal to worse problems fallacy.",False
691,But every country that agreed to be in the EU agreed to an obligation to support other EU countries.,nothing,"initial thoughts:
1. appeal to tradition (argument relies on the historical fact that all countries agreed to an obligation)
2. fallacy of division (infers that the obligation to support other eu countries applies to each individual country based on the agreement by all countries)

group discussion:
1. the obligation to support other eu countries is not necessarily a tradition, as it could have been something agreed upon in more recent times or as part of a treaty, rather than being an historical preference.
2. the fallacy of division can be further explained: just because all countries agreed on the obligation does not mean that each individual country automatically and individually shares this obligation without further explicit stipulation or conditions.

final answer: fallacy of division",False
692,"If marijuana is provided by the pharmacies or health centers to the individuals with prescriptions for health purposes in a controlled way, that should be allowed.",nothing,"step 1: initial observation
- expert 1: appeal to authority (the argument assumes that pharmacists and health care professionals are the authorities on whether marijuana should be provided for medical use.)
- expert 2: false dilemma (the statement presents only two options: marijuana is provided by pharmacies or it's not. however, there may be other ways to provide access to medical marijuana.)
- expert 3: nothing (no specific fallacy can be identified from the initial observation; the statement appears to be a valid argument based on its surface content.)

step 2: analysis of reasoning
- expert 1: withdraws (the argument does not assume that pharmacists and health care professionals are the only authorities on medical marijuana, so this is not an appeal to authority.)
- expert 2: withdraws (the statement does present more than two options for providing access to medical marijuana, such as through dispensaries or home delivery services.)
- expert 3: nothing (no change in initial observation; the argument still appears valid based on its surface content.)

step 3: conclusion
- expert 1 and 2 have withdrawn, leaving only expert 3.
- expert 3: answer: nothing (the argument, as presented, does not contain a fallacy according to the described list of fallacies.)",True
693,"Everyone can choose what movies to watch, and we should respect everyone's preferences.",nothing,"initial thought: appeal to positive emotion (the argument tries to make the action seem reasonable by appealing to a positive emotion rather than giving substantial evidence).

second thought: everyone could also argue that this is not an appeal to positive emotion but instead an expression of respect for individual freedom, which is a fundamental value in society. however, the initial argument still relies on an emotional response (respecting everyone's preferences) without providing evidence or reason.

final answer: appeal to positive emotion.",False
694,Making money out of someone else's art product is stealing. Apple should simply avoid that and pay the royalties.,nothing,"the first expert identifies the fallacy as ""appeal to authority."" this is because the argument assumes that apple, a technology company, should act in accordance with an ethical principle (not stealing) based on an unstated assumption that apple is an authority on ethics.

the second expert agrees that it is an appeal to authority but also points out that the statement implies a false equivalence between making money off someone else's work and actual theft, which can be classified as ""equivocation."" this expert highlights that while making money from someone else's art product may not be ethical, it doesn't equate to stealing.

the third expert acknowledges both the appeal to authority and the equivocation but adds that the statement uses the concept of theft to make the argument more compelling or emotionally charged, which is an ""appeal to anger."" the expert argues that the emotional manipulation detracts from the objective truth of the situation.

the final answer: answer: appeal to authority, equivocation, and appeal to anger.",False
695,Of course they should be allowed to enter the country.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): the statement seems to use an appeal to emotion, as it is trying to make the argument appear reasonable by appealing to the positive direction of happiness rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of allowing people into the country.

step 2 (expert 2): indeed, the statement is also a non-sequitur fallacy, as allowing people into the country is not directly related to creating happiness for those already in the country.

step 3 (expert 3): additionally, there might be concerns about national security or other relevant factors that have not been addressed. the argument lacks information and consideration of these important aspects, making it a case of oversimplification or hasty generalization.

answer: appeal to positive emotion and oversimplification/hasty generalization.",False
696,"The price of milk should not be increased. It is an important healthy drink. If we increase it, things like pop might become the more affordable go-to choice.",nothing,"step 1 (expert a): this argument uses an appeal to emotion to manipulate the decision to not increase the price of milk.

step 2 (expert b): the argument does not provide any evidence or rational reasoning for why increasing the price of milk will lead to a significant shift in consumer behavior towards less healthy alternatives like pop.

step 3 (expert c): there is no explicit comparison being made to the worst case scenario to make the current situation appear better, so it's not an appeal to worse problems.

final answer: appeal to positive emotion",False
697,"After reminding the baby-carrier woman of the consequences and the possible health-related problems, the decision should be left to first her and second to the partner because the woman is the laborer of the process and both parties are the initial responsibles.",nothing,"answer: appeal to tradition

explanation step 1: the argument suggests that the decision should be left to the woman due to tradition (she being the laborer of the process).
explanation step 2: this implies that following traditional gender roles is justification for current actions, which is a fallacy.
explanation step 3: the final step would involve considering alternative perspectives and arguments that are not rooted in tradition.",False
698,We need to prevent another school tragedy so one way to do that would be to have 911 at hand at all times.,nothing,answer: appeal to fear,False
699,"You can have several hundred friends on Facebook. In the real world, it is impossible.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

expert 1: the term ""real world"" has two meanings here - online (facebook) and physical (offline). however, they are used interchangeably without clarification which meaning applies.

expert 2: the argument assumes that online interactions are not considered part of the real world for the purposes of this discussion, but there is no explanation or justification provided to support this assumption.

expert 3: the argument equates facebook with the physical world, which is an incorrect and misleading use of the term ""real world"" in this context.",False
700,"No. No one deserves that title. Since players play such different positions, you can't really compare goalies and offensive players and defensive players. Perhaps you could argue that someone was the best player in a position, but Ronaldo and others can't be named the best in the world.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the argument seems to rely on its own premise (i.e., players play different positions) to support its conclusion (i.e., comparing goalies and offensive players is not possible).

expert 2: indeed, the argument appears to assume that because players play different positions, it follows that they can't be compared in any meaningful way. this creates a circular reasoning fallacy.

expert 3: no further steps needed as i concur with expert 2's analysis. the argument is committing the circular reasoning fallacy by using its premise (players play different positions) to support its conclusion without providing additional evidence or logic.",False
701,Animal testing leads to medicaments with fewer harmful side effects.,nothing,"answer: appeal to authority (without proper supporting evidence)

expert 1: this argument seems to rely on an unidentified expert's claim that animal testing leads to medicaments with fewer harmful side effects.
expert 2: the argument is making the assumption that there is a single authority whose opinion is considered as absolute truth without any additional information or supporting evidence provided.
expert 3: the statement does not provide the identity of this alleged authority, nor any evidence demonstrating their expertise in this specific field, so it can be classified as an appeal to false authority.",False
702,Because all immigrants must be equal.,nothing,"answer: appeal to equality (equality fallacy)

explanation step 1: the statement assumes that all immigrants are equal, implying they have the same skills, qualities, and experiences. this is not necessarily true as individuals may vary greatly.

explanation step 2: the statement suggests that because some immigrants might be beneficial to society, all immigrants must be equally so, which is an oversimplification of reality.

explanation step 3: the statement does not account for the fact that some immigrants might bring negative aspects or pose threats to society, while others may not. therefore, it would be incorrect and unfair to equate all immigrants in this manner.

final answer: appeal to equality (equality fallacy)",False
703,We should allow animal testing!,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): the statement appears to be an appeal to fear, as it suggests that a negative outcome (not allowing animal testing) could lead to unknown consequences. however, the argument lacks evidence or reasoning to support this claim.

step 2 (expert 2): the argument also seems to be using guilt by association, implying that not allowing animal testing will lead to suffering and death for humans due to delayed medical advancements. this is fallacious because the connection between animal testing and human health advancements may not hold true in all cases.

step 3 (expert 3): the argument does not seem to be appealing to tradition, as there is no mention of past practices or historical precedents being invoked to support the claim.

answer: appeal to fear and guilt by association",False
704,Animal testing is a good alternative to human testing.,nothing,"answer: appeal to false authority

explanation (step 1): the statement claims that animal testing is a good alternative to human testing, but no actual expert in the field is cited as the source of this claim.

explanation (step 2): the justification for using animals instead of humans in testing is not based on evidence or reason, but rather an unverified assumption that animals can adequately represent human physiology and responses to drugs and other substances.

explanation (step 3): there is significant disagreement among experts about the validity of animal testing as a substitute for human testing due to differences in species-specific physiology, anatomy, metabolism, genetics, and disease pathologies between humans and animals.

explanation (step 4): the use of animals in research has also been criticized by various organizations and individuals on ethical grounds due to the potential suffering caused to these animals.

explanation (step 5): therefore, the claim that animal testing is a good alternative to human testing is based on unfounded assumptions and not supported by expert consensus or evidence.",False
705,Microsoft just recently revealed some great new innovative products.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be an example of an appeal to positive emotion, as it is trying to make the argument appear reasonable by appealing to the position emotion rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the claim that microsoft's products are innovative.

step 2 (expert 2): however, there is no direct attempt to manipulate emotions here. it may just be a straightforward statement about microsoft's new products, not an emotional appeal.

step 3 (expert 1): upon reevaluation, you are correct that there might not have been an intentional emotional appeal in this statement. let us continue with further analysis.

step 4 (expert 2): the claim does not provide any evidence or reason for why microsoft's products are innovative. it is merely stating the fact of their recent revelation without substantiating it, which could potentially be a form of circular reasoning if the evidence for their innovation comes from the very statement itself.

step 5 (expert 1): upon reconsideration, you are correct that this statement might not be an example of circular reasoning. however, the lack of supporting evidence makes it difficult to determine the validity of the claim and therefore creates a question mark around its truthfulness.

answer: nothing (as there is no fallacy class that can be clearly identified in the given statement).",True
706,A global environment task force is a major requirement.,nothing,"step 1: identifying the argument structure (circular reasoning)
- the statement suggests that since a global environment task force is required, it implies that there is an environmental problem that needs addressing.
- however, the existence of the task force itself is used as evidence for the need to address the environmental issue. this creates a circular reasoning fallacy.

step 2: checking if it's still valid after removing potential biases (circular reasoning)
- if we remove the assumption that the existence of the task force proves an environmental problem, we have no reason or evidence provided to support the need for the task force.

step 3: final agreement among experts
- the argument is circular in reasoning.",False
707,It is not fair to judge students by grades.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be an example of 'appeal to emotion' fallacy, as the argument is trying to manipulate emotions to make the conclusion seem reasonable without providing substantial evidence.

step 2 (expert 2): however, upon closer examination, it appears that the appeal to emotion here is more specific - 'appeal to pity'. the student is using a plea for sympathy to support their argument against grading students based on grades.

step 3 (expert 3): upon further analysis, we can see that the argument itself does not necessarily rely on an emotional response to be valid. it is possible to discuss fairness in grading without appealing to pity. in this case, the argument could be framed as 'it's unfair to judge students solely based on grades'. therefore, the initial interpretation of the fallacy may have been incorrect.

step 4 (expert 1): upon reviewing the statement again, it appears that no specific fallacy can be identified, as there is no attempt to use fear, false authority, association, anger, or straw man in this argument. the argument seems to be a straightforward statement about fairness without any emotional manipulation or logical fallacies.

final answer: answer: nothing (no identified fallacy)",True
708,"Every country should aim for growth, but ultimately environmental sustainability and equalitarian distribution of wealth should be first.",nothing,"step 1: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)
step 2: comparison between two extremes (sustainable growth vs. environmental sustainability and equalitarian distribution of wealth)
step 3: the argument is making a scenario better by comparing it to the worst case scenario (growth vs. environmental degradation and social inequality)
step 4: nothing (no fallacy of circular reasoning, guilt by association, straw man fallacy, equivocation, or appeal to fear observed in this statement)
final answer: appeal to positive emotion",True
709,"Single sex education has been very good for girls, especially.",nothing,"step 1: appeal to tradition
reasoning: the claim is based on the historical practice of single-sex education, implying that because it has worked in the past, it should continue to be effective today. this assumes that historical preferences are still relevant and correct in modern times.

step 2: fallacy of division
reasoning: it is not necessarily true that what works for one group (girls) will work for all parts of that group. in this case, the success of single-sex education for girls does not mean it will be equally effective for every individual girl.

step 3: nothing
reasoning: at this point, we can see that the statement contains both an appeal to tradition and a fallacy of division. however, without further context or evidence, it is impossible to determine if there are any additional fallacies present in the statement.

answer: 'answer: appeal to tradition and fallacy of division'",True
710,"With the goal in mind to improve everyone's situation, growth is good for a country.",nothing,"answer: appeal to positive emotion
explanation: the argument attempts to manipulate the emotions of the reader to a positive direction to make the argument seem reasonable without giving substantial evidence in favor of growth being good for a country.",False
711,Medicine has proven that marijuana is good to mitigate some bad effects of cancer-related side effects. Make it easier for those patients and legalize it.,nothing,"the classification process would look like this:

expert 1: this statement appears to be an appeal to positive emotion, as the argument is being made based on the emotional appeal to ease the suffering of cancer patients rather than providing evidence from medicine that marijuana is proven to mitigate side effects.

expert 2: however, the argument does reference 'medicine' and 'proven,' so let us look deeper into it.

expert 3: the term 'good' in this context might be ambiguous and equivocate between being beneficial for cancer patients and being morally good. this could potentially be equivocation.

expert 1: now, going back to the original premise that marijuana is good for mitigating side effects, let us find evidence from medicine to support this claim. if we do not find any or insufficient evidence, then our initial conclusion about it being an appeal to positive emotion would stand.

(after searching for evidence)...

expert 3: after researching the topic further, i found some scientific studies suggesting that marijuana can help with specific cancer-related symptoms. however, the argument still seems to rely on emotional appeal rather than the evidence provided, so it is also an appeal to positive emotion.

expert 2: taking into account all the points brought up, i agree that this statement can be classified as both an appeal to positive emotion and equivocation due to the ambiguity in the term 'good.'

answer: answer: appeal to positive emotion, equivocation.",False
712,Animal testing helps save lives.,nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to positive emotion)

expert 1: this statement is trying to make an argument appear reasonable by appealing to the position of positive emotions (saving lives). however, it does not provide substantial evidence in favor of animal testing.

expert 2: the argument does not give evidence that animal testing directly leads to saving lives and only relies on emotional manipulation to make the conclusion seem acceptable.

expert 3: no further steps needed; we have reached a consensus.",False
713,Farmers deserve to be paid enough.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to emotion (the use of emotions, in this case positive emotion, to make the argument seem reasonable)

step 2 (expert 2): no fallacy detected so far; still evaluating.

step 3 (expert 1): the statement does not provide any substantial evidence to support that farmers deserve to be paid enough; therefore, it's missing a crucial piece of information needed for a valid argument.

step 4 (expert 2): agrees with the reasoning that there is no evidential support provided for the claim.

answer: nothing (no fallacy detected after examination and discussion)",True
714,Home schooling has many benefits and therefore should be the first choice for parents.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to benefit (also known as an argumentum ad virtutem)
reasoning: the statement suggests that because home schooling has many benefits, it is the best choice for parents. this fallacy occurs when a conclusion is reached based solely on the perceived merits of one option without considering other factors or alternatives.

step 2: appeal to emotion (also known as an argumentum ad passiones)
reasoning: the statement tries to evoke positive emotions by emphasizing the benefits of home schooling, rather than providing evidence to support the conclusion that it is the best choice for parents.

step 3: nothing (since the experts have come to a final agreement)
answer: appeal to benefit and appeal to emotion",True
715,"I don't think daycare services should be provided by high schools themselves, rather existing facilities (kindergarten) should be used. The main point of high schools is to educate people, not to care about babies.",nothing,"answer: appeal to tradition

step 1: the argument suggests that since it has been traditional for kindergartens to provide daycare services, it is appropriate for high schools to do the same. this is an example of using historical preferences (tradition) as evidence for a claim.

step 2: however, just because it was acceptable in past cultures and times does not mean that this practice should continue today without reconsideration or questioning whether it's appropriate. this shows a logical fallacy known as appeal to tradition.",False
716,Children are not active when sitting in front of a TV.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of the fallacy of division, as it infers that something is true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole (children).
step 2 (expert 2): however, the statement does not explicitly state that all children are inactive when sitting in front of a tv. it might only be suggesting that the particular child being discussed is inactive.
step 3 (expert 3): therefore, since the conclusion is not necessarily true for all children and only applies to a specific child, this statement does not qualify as the fallacy of division.
answer: nothing",True
717,"Although it is a barbarian act, we need animal testing.",nothing,"answer: appeal to emotion

explanation step 1 (expert 1): the argument uses the emotion of fear or concern for human well-being as the primary motivator.
explanation step 2 (expert 2): however, there is no justification provided for the claim that animal testing is necessary for improving human health and safety.
explanation step 3 (expert 3): the argument also does not provide evidence to show that animal testing is the only or most effective method for achieving these goals.",False
718,"Nowadays, nuclear power is the most effective and safest energy source we have.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be an assertion rather than an argument, but i'll treat it as one for this exercise. the claim of being ""most effective"" requires some sort of comparison or evidence.

step 2 (expert 2): however, the claim that nuclear power is the ""safest"" energy source might be questionable considering past incidents like chernobyl and fukushima. this brings up the topic of safety compared to other energy sources.

step 3 (expert 3): but the argument lacks a balanced comparison with other energy sources regarding safety and effectiveness. comparison is important when making such claims as it provides context and avoids circular reasoning.

step 4 (expert 1): in addition, the statement does not address potential downsides of nuclear power such as waste management, proliferation risks, or economic considerations.

step 5 (expert 2): furthermore, there is no explanation or evidence provided to support the claim that nuclear power is currently the ""most effective"" energy source, which makes it a questionable assertion.

step 6 (expert 3): finally, the statement does not consider the future technological advancements and developments in renewable energy sources, which could potentially render this statement false in the near future.

answer: circular reasoning, lack of comparison, insufficient evidence, ignoring potential downsides, and failure to account for future developments (multiple fallacies)",False
719,"Accepting immigrants in Europe must be taken seriously and deserves coordination and investments, as we cannot directly influence the sources of immigration - ending the war in Libya or changing the regime in Eritrea.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

step 1: the statement suggests that because we (europe) cannot influence the sources of immigration (ending the war in libya or changing the regime in eritrea), we should invest and coordinate to accept immigrants.

step 2: however, the reason given for why we cannot influence the sources of immigration is also based on our inability to directly influence them. this creates a circular argument where the conclusion depends on its own premise.",False
720,Animal testing for medical purposes should be allowed.,nothing,"step 1 (expert a): this statement appears to be an appeal to consequence, where a beneficial outcome (medical advancements) is being used as justification for a controversial practice (animal testing).

step 2 (expert b): however, the argument does not necessarily imply that there are no alternative ways of achieving those medical advancements without resorting to animal testing. thus, it can be considered a fallacy of false cause or oversimplification.

step 3 (expert c): if we assume that there are in fact no alternative ways for achieving the desired medical advancements, then the argument could also be considered an appeal to necessity, where the controversial practice is deemed necessary because of the importance of its supposed benefits. however, this still does not account for potential ethical issues and harm caused to animals.

step 4 (expert a): upon reconsideration, even if we grant that there are no alternatives for achieving medical advancements, the argument does not provide any information about the nature or extent of the harms caused to the animals being tested. therefore, it can be considered an example of appeal to ignorance, where unsupported assumptions are made due to a lack of evidence.

step 5 (expert b): in addition, the argument does not consider the potential long-term consequences and ethical implications of continuing animal testing for medical purposes. thus, it could also be classified as an appeal to short-term benefits or an oversight of relevant factors.

answer: fallacy of false cause/oversimplification (with elements of appeal to necessity, appeal to ignorance, and appeal to short-term benefits)",False
721,"No. Greece is one of the countries that, in its history, has contributed to a European union the most. Throwing this country out of it, would therefore destroy confidence in this community, the most.",nothing,"answer: appeal to tradition

expert 1: the statement starts by stating that greece has contributed to the european union ""in its history"", implying that the current situation is being compared to a past state.

expert 2: the statement also uses the phrase ""would destroy confidence,"" suggesting that the consequences of removing greece from the eu could result in negative repercussions, which is based on historical preferences and traditions rather than current facts.

expert 3: furthermore, the argument relies on the assumption that the european union's future will be similar to its past, which assumes that the union's traditions will remain constant.",False
722,"Interestingly, the boys I know from single-sex schools seem more against it than the girls and they do feel they were socially hampered a bit.",nothing,"this statement appears to be an example of 'appeal to tradition'. the reasoning behind this is as follows:

1. the statement suggests that a certain behavior (opposition to mixed-gender schools) is more common among boys from single-sex schools, implying that this behavior has historical roots and is therefore considered acceptable or traditional.
2. however, the fact that something has been accepted in the past does not necessarily mean it should continue to be accepted today, as societal norms and attitudes can change over time. this is where the fallacy lies: using historical preferences as evidence for the correctness of a current position (in this case, the preference of boys from single-sex schools towards mixed-gender schools).

therefore, the answer is: 'answer: appeal to tradition'.",False
723,"To revisit the oceans paleotemperatures now, we need to carefully quantify this re-equilibration, which has been overlooked for too long. For that, we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the argument suggests that re-equilibration in oceans paleotemperatures needs to be carefully quantified, and this is necessary because it has been overlooked for too long. however, the very act of stating that it has been overlooked implies that we already knew it should have been quantified, which is a circular argument.

expert 2: building on expert 1's observation, the claim that we must work on other marine organisms to understand sediment over geological time supports the need for careful quantification of re-equilibration, but this conclusion relies on the very premise that needs to be proven - that the re-equilibration has been overlooked.

expert 3: agree with experts 1 and 2. in this case, we have a circular reasoning fallacy since the claim relies on its own premise to support the conclusion.",False
724,Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated.,nothing,"step 1: appeal to authority (the experts are being used as evidence)
step 2: appeal to fear (the implication is that something catastrophic or unexpected might happen because the ice melted faster than predicted)
answer: appeal to fear, appeal to authority",False
725,Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up.,nothing,"answer: appeal to tradition fallacy

step 1: the statement implies that because mass coral bleaching was not observed before the 1980s, it is an unprecedented phenomenon.
step 2: however, we can't infer that if mass coral bleaching wasn't observed in the past, it cannot occur or has never happened before the 1980s. there could have been other factors (e.g., lack of observation, limited resources) preventing us from noticing it earlier.
step 3: therefore, the argument is based on historical preferences (the traditional view that mass coral bleaching did not occur prior to the 1980s), which does not mean it is correct today.",False
726,"Back in the late 1980s, the UN claimed that if global warming were not checked by 2000, rising sea levels would wash entire countries away.",nothing,answer: appeal to fear,False
727,Extremely remarkable 2017 heads toward record for hottest year without an El Niño episode.,nothing,"answer: appeal to authority (fallacy)

expert 1: the statement claims that 2017 is headed towards a record for the hottest year, but it does not specify who made this claim or what their qualifications are.

expert 2: the claim that 2017 is ""extremely remarkable"" for being hot lacks any actual data to support it.

expert 3: the statement uses the phrase ""without an el niño episode,"" but many climatologists agree that el niño or la niña events only account for a small portion of global temperatures. the rest is due to overall anthropogenic climate change and natural cycles.

therefore, the use of ""authority"" without specifying any qualifications, lack of supporting data, and inappropriate connection between an el niño episode and global temperatures indicates that this statement relies on the appeal to authority fallacy.",False
728,"The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours.",nothing,"step 1: appeal to fear (the argument uses the fear of the hurricane becoming more intense due to the unusual warmth as a primary motivator for acceptance without providing justification or evidence)
step 2: nothing (no further step is necessary, as the initial classification has been identified)
answer: appeal to fear",True
729,"As time progresses and fossil fuel emissions increase, the number of record highs should increase and record lows should decrease.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be making a prediction based on the correlation between two variables - fossil fuel emissions and weather records. however, it does not provide any evidence or reasoning as to why this correlation exists or how strong it is, which makes it an argument from ignorance or appeal to consequences (depending on the interpretation).

step 2 (expert 2): the statement also seems to ignore other factors that may impact weather patterns, such as solar activity, ocean currents, and natural climate variability. by focusing solely on fossil fuel emissions, it commits the fallacy of oversimplification or hasty generalization.

step 3 (expert 3): additionally, the statement appears to be assuming a cause-and-effect relationship between the two variables without adequate evidence. this is an example of the causality fallacy.

step 4: all experts agree that the statement exhibits multiple fallacies, specifically the argument from ignorance/appeal to consequences, oversimplification/hasty generalization, and causality fallacy.

answer: multiple fallacies (argument from ignorance/appeal to consequences, oversimplification/hasty generalization, causality fallacy)",False
730,"Scientists such as Dr Willie Soon, a solar astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, have shown that as water vapor rises, so does temperature. It is why cloudless nights are so chilly.",nothing,"'answer: fallacy of equivocation'

explanation step 1 (scientist a): the term ""as"" implies a direct relationship between the rising of water vapor and temperature. however, it's not stated whether this causal relationship is temporal or proportional. this creates ambiguity in the argument.

explanation step 2 (scientist b): in the statement, it is not clear if the rise of water vapor causes a temporary decrease in temperature (cloudless nights are chilly) or if an increase in temperature results in more water vapor rising. this confusion highlights the equivocation fallacy.

explanation step 3 (scientist c): since there's ambiguity regarding whether the relationship between rising water vapor and temperature is temporal or proportional, as well as a lack of specification on what type of rise in water vapor or temperature is being referred to, it can be concluded that the argument employs the fallacy of equivocation.",False
731,"Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) from 1901 to 2010, and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century.",nothing,"step 1 - appeal to fear: the statement uses the fear of a drastic increase in temperatures as a motivator to accept the conclusion that there will be a significant rise in temperatures by the end of this century. however, the argument does not provide justification for the claim that the temperature will rise by six degrees or more.

step 2 - nothing: the statement does not make any further fallacious appeals, as it presents factual data and climate models without manipulating emotions, distorting truths, or using false authorities.

answer: nothing",True
732,"Sea ice thickness also substantially declined in the latter half of the 20th century, the snow and ice data center said.",nothing,"initial expert 1: this statement seems to be an example of 'appeal to authority' fallacy as the claim is being made based on what a specific authority (the snow and ice data center) says without any additional supporting evidence.

initial expert 2: however, if we assume that this authority is indeed credible and has a good reputation for providing accurate information, then we can say it's not necessarily a fallacy.

final expert: in this case, assuming the snow and ice data center is a credible source, there is no apparent fallacy in the statement. 'answer: nothing'.",True
733,The world’s alpine glaciers recorded a net annual loss of ice for the 36th consecutive year and the Greenland ice sheet experienced melting over more than 50% of its surface.,nothing,"answer: appeal to fear

expert 1: this statement starts with an assertion about a significant issue (loss of glaciers, melting of the greenland ice sheet) which can be scary or worrying for many people.

expert 2: however, no clear connection is made between this issue and the proposed conclusion that suggests action should be taken to address the issue.

expert 3: therefore, the statement uses fear as a primary motivator without providing evidence or reason to accept the proposed conclusion, resulting in an appeal to fear fallacy.",False
734,"These facts are completely supported by 4,000 ocean floats.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning
explanation: the claim is based on the evidence of 4,000 ocean floats, but the argument does not provide any reason or explanation as to why these floats support the truthfulness of the facts stated. thus, the conclusion relies on its own premise for support, creating a circle in reasoning where no useful information is being shared.",False
735,"Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean, and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere.",nothing,"step 1: appeal to tradition (the argument relies on historical preferences as evidence)
step 2: fallacy of division (the argument infers that something is true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole)
step 3: equivocation (the term ""atmosphere"" can refer to both the gaseous envelope surrounding earth and the air in a specific location, creating ambiguity)
answer: fallacy of division and equivocation",False
736,"Last year's warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef experienced its worst coral bleaching event on record and large scale coral death, to the Arctic, where sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were also the warmest on record, at least from January through September 2016.",nothing,"answer: appeal to worse problems

expert 1: the statement suggests that the current year's warmth is exceptional due to it being the worst on record for the great barrier reef and arctic. this implies that the argument might be less convincing if it weren’t for the comparison to these extreme scenarios, making it an example of the appeal to worse problems fallacy.

expert 2: by comparing last year's warmth across various regions and showing record-breaking events in those areas, the statement tries to make the situation seem more dire than it might be if only a specific area was mentioned. this is another example of the appeal to worse problems fallacy as it uses extreme scenarios to make the current problem appear more severe.

expert 3: the comparison made between different geographical locations and their respective record-breaking events aims at emphasizing the severity of the issue, which might mislead listeners into accepting the conclusion that last year's warmth was an exceptionally significant event. this further demonstrates the appeal to worse problems fallacy.

since all experts agree on the classification, the final answer remains unchanged: answer: appeal to worse problems.",False
737,"We have known for decades that increasing CO2 and precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century, it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of division

step 1: recognize the argument makes a claim about the whole (global biomass) based on assumptions about individual parts (increasing co2 and precipitation).
step 2: realize that this assumption is not guaranteed, as other factors such as temperature variability, soil quality, and species interactions can affect the growth of plants.
step 3: identify that the argument infers from the whole to the individual parts without considering all relevant factors.
step 4: conclude that the fallacy of division has been committed.",False

California’s first-, second-, and third-hottest years on record, in terms of statewide average temperatures, were 2014, 2015, and 2016.",nothing,"answer: appeal to tradition

step 1 (expert 1): the statement mentions that the most recent five-year drought is the driest on record in terms of statewide precipitation. however, it does not specify if this period was also the hottest, as suggested by the statement.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement implies that high temperatures caused the drought, but the argument lacks evidence to support this claim directly. instead, it uses california's first-, second-, and third-hottest years on record, in terms of statewide average temperatures, as supporting evidence for the assertion that warm weather worsened the drought.

step 3 (expert 3): the argument employs an appeal to tradition fallacy by assuming that because california experienced its first-, second-, and third-hottest years on record during this particular drought, high temperatures must have caused or worsened it. the argument ignores other potential factors contributing to the drought.",False
740,Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic's summer sea-ice cover.,nothing,"initial thoughts: the argument seems to be making a prediction about the future (record low in the arctic's summer sea-ice cover) based on a belief or assumption rather than concrete evidence.

expert 1: the argument may not be based on any specific, verifiable data or research, just an expectation or opinion. possible fallacy: appeal to unverified authority (if the speaker is perceived as an expert).

expert 2: the prediction is not supported by evidence of previous trends or data analysis. possible fallacy: appeal to ignorance (because no contrary evidence is presented, it's assumed that the expected event will occur).

expert 3: the argument does not provide a clear reasoning as to why this year would see a record low in the arctic's summer sea-ice cover. possible fallacy: fallacy of insufficient statistics (the argument lacks the necessary data or information needed to support its claim).

final answer: answer: appeal to ignorance",False
741,"At the bottom of the world, sea ice is also at all-time record low levels around Antarctica, the data center said. The lack of ice in the Antarctic, where it is currently summer, is most pronounced in the Amundsen Sea, where only a few scattered patches of ice remain.",nothing,"answer: appeal to authority

743,"An inherent bias in scientific journals in favor of more calamitous predictions has excluded research showing that marine creatures are not damaged by ocean acidification, which is caused by the sea absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",nothing,"answer: appeal to fear (or fallacy of omission)

explanation step 1: the statement implies that if more calamitous predictions about ocean acidification were published, then research showing marine creatures are not damaged by it would be excluded. this is an appeal to fear because it suggests that the exclusion of such research is due to its potentially less alarming or less catastrophic findings, which could make policymakers and the public less concerned about addressing the issue.

explanation step 2: however, this argument overlooks the possibility that the omission of studies with less severe findings might be due to other reasons such as their poor methodology, lack of replicability, or insufficient evidence to support their claims. the implication that the exclusion was based solely on fear of less dramatic results is not supported by the provided information.

explanation step 3: therefore, the argument does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that inherent bias in scientific journals favors more calamitous predictions. the use of fear to justify this claim constitutes an appeal to fear fallacy or fallacy of omission, as it overlooks other potential explanations for the omission of less severe findings.",False
744,"The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century. The risk is that the rate will increase still more. Scientists who study the Earth's history say waters could rise by a foot per decade in a worst-case scenario, though that looks unlikely.

745,"CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: the statement infers that because co2 is a trace component in the atmosphere (0.04%), it is only a trace greenhouse gas, which is not accurate when considering its effect as part of the whole.

expert 2: this reasoning ignores the fact that while water vapor makes up 95% of atmospheric greenhouse gases, co2 still plays a significant role in trapping heat and contributing to global warming. the proportion doesn't equate to its effect on the whole.",False
746,"The atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is five years and it is quickly sequestered into plants, marine life, oceans, and sediments.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): the statement discusses the residency time of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

step 2 (expert 2): it also mentions how carbon dioxide is quickly sequestered into various natural systems like plants, marine life, oceans, and sediments.

step 3 (expert 3): by stating that the residency time is five years, it may give an incorrect impression that once co2 levels are reduced, its impact on the climate will cease within this time frame. this could be considered a form of 'appeal to false authority', as the statement may not accurately reflect the long-term effects and interactions between carbon dioxide and the earth's climate system.

step 4 (expert 1): however, the intention behind the statement seems to be informative rather than persuasive or misleading. it is crucial to understand the difference between providing information that may have some oversimplifications and deliberately using a fallacy to deceive or manipulate people's beliefs.

step 5 (expert 2): considering the context of the conversation, if the statement were used as an argument for short-term climate policy without acknowledging the long-term consequences, it could be seen as an 'appeal to false authority'. but given that the original statement appears to be informative and not persuasive, we cannot definitively classify it as a fallacy.

answer: nothing (the statement is presenting information rather than using a fallacious argument)",True
747,"Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the average pH of global ocean surface waters has fallen from pH 8.2 to 8.1. This represents an increase in acidity of about 26%.",nothing,"initial thoughts: the argument seems to be making a claim about the change in ph levels and acidity of the ocean surface waters, using facts as evidence. however, without more context, it's difficult to identify a specific fallacy.

step 1: check for an appeal to emotion, fear or anger (as described above) - nothing found

step 2: check for an appeal to authority - the argument is based on factual data, so no expert is being falsely used as evidence.

step 3: check for an appeal to worse problems or straw man fallacy - no comparison is made between the situation and a worse scenario, nor is the original argument distorted or misrepresented.

step 4: check for circular reasoning, guilt by association, equivocation, fallacy of division or tu quoque - there's no clear evidence of these fallacies in the given statement.

748,Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems.,nothing,"'answer: appeal to tradition'

explanation step 1 (first expert): the statement suggests that nations should continue with traditional energy systems, possibly based on historical preferences or practices.

Several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century, resulting in a net increase in island area.",nothing,"answer: appeal to tradition
explanation: the argument infers that because several studies have shown this pattern for the marshall islands, it should be assumed as true for all other islands without additional evidence or reasoning. this is an example of the fallacy of appeal to tradition, since the historical preference (in this case, the pattern observed in the marshall islands) is used as evidence for a current argument, rather than providing new or relevant evidence for the broader claim.",False
750,The Northern Hemisphere jet stream flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large. But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated. That’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes.,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation step 1: the statement that the jet stream's flow becomes weakened and elongated when the arctic warms up faster than the equator, causing extreme weather, is being used as evidence to support the claim that a large temperature difference in the northern hemisphere makes the jet stream flow stronger.
explanation step 2: however, the argument assumes that a weakened and elongated jet stream flow (caused by the warming arctic) is evidence of a strong jet stream (which happens when there's a large temperature difference). this creates a circular reasoning because the conclusion depends on the very thing it is intended to prove.",False
751,"In 2004, two NOAA scientists, Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine, produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels. But then, just over a year ago, Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information his results were surprising: there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last century.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

1st expert: the chart produced by feely and sabine shows a strong correlation, but it does not specify what kind of correlation (causal, coincidental, etc.). this could be interpreted as a causal relationship, but that interpretation might not hold if the correlation is merely coincidental or otherwise.

2nd expert: additionally, wallace's findings seem to contradict feely and sabine's chart, yet he does not provide any context for how their omission of certain data affects their conclusion about falling oceanic ph levels in the last century. this could imply that the correlation claimed by feely and sabine is not a causal one, but rather an equivocal or misleading one.

3rd expert: further examination reveals that wallace's research might have uncovered data omitted by feely and sabine, which would explain their contradictory findings about oceanic ph levels in the last century. however, without more information on how this missing data impacts the original correlation, it remains unclear whether the correlation observed is causal or merely equivocal.

4th expert: finally, to come to a final agreement, it is essential to gather all relevant information and analyze it thoroughly to determine whether the correlation between atmospheric co2 levels and oceanic ph levels is causal or merely coincidental (equivocal). until such an analysis has been conducted, the conclusion that there has been no reduction in oceanic ph levels in the last century remains unsupported.",False
752,"Australias Great Barrier Reef is one of the world’s greatest reservoirs of biodiversity. A World Heritage site, it is currently under assault from unusually hot ocean temperatures.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be a claim about a natural phenomenon (the condition of the great barrier reef) and the reasoning provided for that claim seems to be based on an emotional appeal rather than evidence or facts.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement also implies that the current state of the great barrier reef is unique and irreplaceable, which could be considered as an oversimplification or generalization without providing specific details about its biodiversity.

step 3 (expert 3): however, it's worth noting that the statement does provide a reason for the potential impact on the great barrier reef, which is unusual ocean temperatures. this is not based on emotions but on observable and measurable phenomena.

step 4 (all experts): upon reconsideration, we realize that even though the statement presents an emotional appeal in describing it as one of the world’s greatest reservoirs of biodiversity, it does provide a rational explanation for its current state through the mention of unusual ocean temperatures. therefore, answer: nothing (no fallacy found in this statement).",True
753,"Consider where they move. Migration patterns show people heading for warm states like Texas and Florida, not snowy Minnesota and Michigan.",nothing,"answer: appeal to worse problems

expert 1: the argument tries to make a scenario better by comparing it to the worst case scenario (cold states). this is an example of appeal to worse problems.

expert 2: the comparison of migration patterns with cold states and warm states seems irrelevant, as people moving to warmer areas is not necessarily worse than moving to colder areas. the argument relies on this comparison to make a claim, which is a fallacy.

expert 3: the statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning for the claim that people are moving towards warm states because it is better than moving to cold states. it simply states migration patterns without offering justification, making the argument fallacious.

754,"This means it is possible that by some yardsticks, 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of division

step 1 (expert 1): the argument infers that a single event (el nino not vanishing until the middle of the year) applies to an entire period of time (the whole year).

step 2 (expert 2): however, it is not necessarily true that a single event occurring for part of the year would make the entire year significantly hotter. weather patterns are complex and influenced by many factors throughout the year.

step 3 (expert 3): therefore, the argument equates a single part of the whole to the whole itself, which is fallacious reasoning known as 'fallacy of division'.",False
755,Climate change will also reduce the number of cold days and cold spells. That will cut the total number of cold-related deaths.,nothing,"answer: appeal to fear

explanation (step 1): the statement mentions a frightening consequence (a reduction in cold-related deaths) to convince people about climate change. however, this fear is not based on evidence or reason provided in the argument.",False

step 1 (expert 1): the term ""rising atmospheric co2 levels"" and ""falling oceanic ph levels"" are being used, but it's unclear if they refer to a direct causal relationship or correlation.

step 2 (expert 2): there is also no clarification on the time period for both the rising co2 levels and falling ph levels.

758,"The U.S. National Climate Assessment found that U.S. heat waves have already become more frequent and intense, that the U.S. is shattering high temperature records far more frequently than it is shattering low temperature records (just as you’d expect), and that it is seeing correspondingly fewer cold spells.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: the statement makes a claim about the us as a whole, but we can't infer that every part of the us experiences this trend.

expert 2: the trend described in the statement might be true for the country as a whole, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the same pattern holds for heat waves, intense heat, high temperature records, low temperature records, and cold spells within individual regions or cities.

expert 3: we can't infer that all types of weather events in the us are experiencing the trend described because the statement only provides information about one type of weather event (heat waves). the size of the whole (the country) is not directly related to the frequency and intensity of each part of the weather (specific types of storms, heatwaves, etc.).",False
759,The blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted downwards to make it cooler; the red bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer.,nothing,"initial thoughts: this statement seems to suggest that data manipulation is being used in a scientific context, specifically in climate research or meteorology. however, without further context, it's difficult to classify this as a specific fallacy.

first step: let's assume the scenario is about temperature data adjustments for climate research. we can check if the argument is using fear, anger, tradition, or any other emotional appeals to sway the audience.
final answer: nothing (insufficient information to classify a fallacy at this point)

second step: now let's examine whether the data manipulation claim is based on evidence or reason, which could help us determine if it's an appeal to false authority or circular reasoning fallacy.
final answer: nothing (still insufficient information to classify a fallacy at this point)

third step: we need to consider if the argument uses guilt by association to devalue the data adjustments.
final answer: nothing (no indication of guilt by association yet)

fourth step: let's see if there is any equivocation in terms of defining what 'adjusted' means, or if there is a fallacy of division assuming that adjusting some data implies all data is adjusted in the same way.
final answer: nothing (still no clear indication of a specific fallacy)

fifth step: let's analyze whether the argument is making assumptions based on parts of the whole (fallacy of composition or division). in this case, adjusting some data does not necessarily imply that all the data is adjusted in the same way.
final answer: nothing (still no clear indication of a specific fallacy)

sixth step: let's consider if the argument uses tu quoque by claiming that the data manipulation is flawed because those making the adjustments are not acting consistently with their claims.
final answer: nothing (no evidence of tu quoque so far)

seventh step: we should check for any appeal to positive emotion or pity in the argument, as these could be used to distract from the truth of the conclusion.
final answer: nothing (no indication of emotional appeals yet)

eighth step: since we have not found any clear indications of a specific fallacy, let's revisit our initial assumption that this statement is about temperature data adjustments in climate research. if it turns out that there is no scientific justification for the data manipulation claim, it could be classified as an appeal to false authority or circular reasoning, depending on the reasoning behind the claim.
final answer: nothing (still no clear indication of a specific fallacy)

ninth step: if we were to assume that the data manipulation is scientifically justified, there would be no fallacy present in this statement. however, without proper context and evidence, it remains unclear whether the manipulation is indeed justified.
final answer: nothing (still insufficient information to classify a fallacy at this point)

tenth step: if we were to assume that the data manipulation serves political or financial interests instead of scientific ones, it could be classified as an appeal to false authority if those making the adjustments lack proper qualifications or expertise. it could also be considered tu quoque if those making the argument use the justification for the manipulation to discredit others who question the validity of the data.
final answer: nothing (still insufficient information to classify a fallacy at this point)

eleventh step: since we have not found any clear indications of a specific fallacy throughout our analysis, it seems reasonable to conclude that there may not be one present in this statement. it's important to remember that the absence of evidence is not necessarily the evidence of absence, and further investigation would be needed to confirm or refute any potential fallacies.

expert 1: the statement makes a generalization about all wind and solar facilities, but the claim is not necessarily true for every individual facility.

expert 2: it assumes that every single wind or solar facility needs to be supported by coal-fired generators. that's an assumption without evidence.

step 1 (expert 1): the statement uses fear about potential future events as a primary motivator for the reader to accept the conclusion that the heating of the planet should be controlled. there is no justification or evidence provided to support the claim that the heating of the planet will continue unchecked, resulting in the sea level rising by 20-30 feet.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement also implies that if the heating of the planet continues unchecked, the ice sheets in greenland and antarctica will partly disintegrate, causing the sea level to rise. however, there is no evidence or reasoning provided to support this claim.

step 3 (expert 3): there is no additional information or justification presented in the statement that would cause any of us to revise our initial conclusion that the statement is an example of the appeal to fear fallacy. therefore, we agree that the answer is 'answer: appeal to fear'.",False

765,"In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010. But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: the argument infers that because humans contributed more than half to the global temperature rise between 1951 and 2010, other factors are responsible for the remaining increase. however, this assumes that the whole (global temperature rise) is directly related to each part (causes of temperature rise), which is not necessarily the case.

expert 2: the argument fails to recognize that there could be multiple causes contributing to a whole, and it is incorrect to assume that one cause is responsible for an equal proportion of the remaining increase just because another cause contributed more than half.

expert 3: the claim concludes that since humans are responsible for more than half of the global temperature rise from 1951 to 2010, the remaining increase must be due to other causes. this is an oversimplification and a fallacy of division.",False
766,"In the past, the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has been orders of magnitude higher than now, yet there were ice ages.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of the fallacy of division. the argument infers that because the carbon dioxide content was high in the past, it must mean that each individual moment in those times also had high co2 levels.

step 2 (expert 2): however, we know that atmospheric conditions can vary significantly over time, especially on a geological scale. thus, while the average co2 level might have been high, it doesn’t mean that every moment during those periods had the same level of co2.

step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, it is not proven that increased carbon dioxide content causes ice ages directly. other factors like changes in solar radiation, ocean currents, and plate tectonics could also play significant roles.

While growing seasons—which are now either longer or newly possible, depending on the exact location—suck in carbon dioxide during the spring and summer, scientists believe the thawing lands are now emitting more carbon than they take in.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: i see that a specific region (arctic land) is being compared to another (atmosphere), which seems to violate the principle that 'the whole' is not necessarily equal to the sum of its 'parts'. this resembles the fallacy of division.

expert 2: agree, it looks like an assumption that the carbon storage and emission trends of arctic land apply universally to the atmosphere, which could be a case of the fallacy of division.

From 1992 through 1997, Antarctica lost 49 billion tons of ice annually.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of division

step 1: the statement infers that because antarctica as a whole is losing more ice now than it was a decade ago, every part or smaller area of antarctica must be losing more ice as well. this is not necessarily the case, as different areas of the continent may have varying rates of ice loss.

step 2: the statement does not provide evidence for the claim that the rate of ice loss in each specific region of antarctica has tripled over the past decade. it only states that the total amount of ice lost from antarctica as a whole has increased, not necessarily each part individually.

step 3: since the rate of ice loss for different parts of antarctica may vary, it cannot be assumed that every region is losing ice at triple the rate observed in the continent as a whole. this fallacy involves making a conclusion about the specific parts based on observations about the whole, which is not valid reasoning.",False
769,"How did a wet Western winter lead to a sky-choking summer? The answer lies in the summer’s record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts. Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation step 1: the claim relies on its own premise (i.e., the summer's record-breaking heat causing wildfires) to support its conclusion that a wet western winter led to a sky-choking summer due to wildfires.

explanation step 2: there is no independent evidence provided for why days of near-100-degree temperatures are what cause a scorching heat wave in the pacific northwest or how this links back to the original premise of a wet western winter leading to sky-choking summer due to wildfires.

explanation step 3: the claim is essentially saying that a wet western winter leads to a sky-choking summer because of wildfires, and those same wildfires are caused by a scorching heat wave which was caused by the very same wet western winter. this creates a circular argument with no new information being presented.",False

the second expert might say: 'fallacy of division' (it infers that because temperatures are returning to certain levels in general, it means they will return to those levels in all specific instances, such as after the 1998 el nino).

the third expert might say: 'nothing' (if both previous experts have identified fallacies in the statement and there is no additional fallacy present, then there is no further classification needed).

answer: nothing.",True
771,So it’s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm—because the last El Nino ended a year ago.,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the argument seems to be based on the assumption that because the end of el nino was a year ago, we should not expect it to affect 2017's temperatures. however, this claim is used as evidence for why 2017 has been remarkably warm.

expert 2: yes, the argument seems to create a circular reasoning where the conclusion (2017 has been remarkably warm) is being used as an explanation for itself (el nino ended a year ago, so we should not expect it to affect 2017's temperatures).

expert 3: i concur. the argument is based on the premise that because the end of el nino was a year ago, we should not expect it to affect 2017's temperatures. however, this conclusion is contradictory since we are already observing that 2017 has been remarkably warm. therefore, the argument falls into circular reasoning.",False
772,"The dry periods are drier and the wet periods are wetter, said Jeffrey Mount, a water expert and senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

step 1 (expert 1): the statement seems to imply that jeffrey mount's expertise as a water expert justifies his claim about the dry periods being drier and wet periods being wetter.

step 2 (expert 2): however, this same claim is used as evidence for his authority on the subject, creating a circular argument where his expertise is based on the very thing he is trying to prove with his expertise.

773,"Warm weather worsened the most recent five-year drought, which included the driest four-year period on record in terms of statewide precipitation. California’s first-, second- and third-hottest years on record, in terms of statewide average temperatures, were 2014, 2015, and 2016.",nothing,"answer: appeal to worse problems

step 1 (expert 1): the statement implies that because the recent five-year drought included the driest four-year period on record in terms of statewide precipitation, and california had its first-, second- and third-hottest years on record in terms of average temperatures during those years, the warm weather worsened the drought.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement compares the dryness of the recent five-year drought to the driest four-year period on record, and then attempts to make the scenario better by comparing it to the hottest years on record. this is an attempt to make a scenario seem less severe by comparing it to a worst case scenario, which is appeal to worse problems.

step 3 (expert 3): the statement does not provide evidence or reasoning for why warm weather specifically worsened the drought. the implication that warm weather caused the dryness of the recent five-year drought cannot be supported without further evidence and analysis. therefore, the argument relies on comparison to a worst case scenario as its primary motivator, which is appeal to worse problems.

the statement is an example of appeal to worse problems because it tries to make the scenario seem less severe by comparing it to a worst case scenario (the driest four-year period on record), rather than providing evidence and reasoning for why warm weather specifically worsened the drought.",False
774,"CO2 is going up, but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would. The computer models just weren’t reliable.",nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be an example of the fallacy known as 'appeal to false authority'. the assumption here is that the reliability of the computer models is solely based on what was initially believed, rather than evaluating their performance and accuracy in predicting real-world data.

step 2 (expert 2): the statement also seems to be using a form of circular reasoning, as the argument's conclusion relies on the premise that the computer models aren’t reliable. in order to determine whether the models are unreliable or not, one would need independent evidence outside the models themselves.

step 3 (expert 3): lastly, there doesn't appear to be any fear-mongering in this statement, but it seems that the speaker might be overemphasizing the unreliability of the computer models in order to justify their previous misconceptions about co2 levels. this can be classified as an example of the 'appeal to anger' fallacy, as emotions are being used to obscure the validity of the argument.

778,"Burning gas instead of coal in power plants reduces emissions in the short run, though gas is still a fossil fuel and will have to be phased out in the long run.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of division

1st expert: the argument infers that because gas burns less pollutants than coal in the short term, it is beneficial overall. however, this does not account for the long-term consequences of using fossil fuels.

2nd expert: the claim that gas will eventually have to be phased out in the long run further supports the fallacy of division, as it assumes that the benefits from reduced emissions outweigh the drawbacks from continued use of a fossil fuel.

3rd expert: since the argument only considers the immediate benefits of switching from coal to gas while ignoring the eventual necessity for phasing out fossil fuels, it falls under the fallacy of division.",False

783,"Sea level rise is global. But due to a variety of factors – including, for this part of the Atlantic coast, a likely weakening of the Gulf Stream, itself potentially a result of the melting of Greenland’s ice caps – south Floridians are feeling the effects more than many others. While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the claim that the rise in sea level is due to global factors like melting ice caps and local factors like weakening gulf stream implies that these factors are responsible for the sea level rise, but the argument also relies on the assumption that the measured sea level rise is indeed caused by these very same factors.

expert 2: the circular reasoning in this argument occurs because the cause (global factors and local factors) and effect (sea level rise) are intertwined without a neutral third piece of evidence to establish the relationship between them.

expert 3: there is no independent, outside evidence given that establishes the link between global factors, local factors, and sea level rise, making it impossible to validate the claim that south floridians are experiencing more sea level rise due to these particular factors.",False

step 2 (expert 2): however, the statement does not specify what percentage of climate scientists agree with the hypothesis or provide evidence to support this claim, making it an appeal to authority fallacy.

step 3 (expert 3): furthermore, even if there is a consensus among many climate scientists, the acceptance of an idea within a specific field does not necessarily make it universally accepted or factual outside that field.

785,Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off.,nothing,"answer: appeal to fear.
explanation: the statement implies that people will be afraid of global warming if they are told about the potential consequences, but it does not provide any evidence or reason for the claim that unusually warm ocean water and el niño climate pattern caused the die-off. instead, the use of these two factors as reasons to induce fear is fallacious since the cause-effect relationship has not been adequately established.",False
786,"In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010. But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.",nothing,"answer: appeal to fear

step 1 (expert 1): the argument implies that if humans are not taking action to reduce emissions, there will be a significant increase in global average temperature. however, this implication is based on the assumption that the other half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010 is not coming from natural causes.

step 2 (expert 2): the argument does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the claim that the other half of the observed increase in global average temperature is caused by human activities, rather than natural fluctuations.

step 3 (expert 3): as such, the fear that if humans do not take action, there will be a significant increase in global average temperature is unjustified because it is based on an assumption without evidence or reason. therefore, the argument is an example of an appeal to fear fallacy.",False

expert 1: this statement suggests that there is a possibility of a worst-case scenario (11 feet of ocean level rise). however, it doesn't provide evidence or reasoning to support the claim that carbon emissions will track on something resembling a worst-case scenario.

expert 2: the statement tries to use the fear of a worst-case scenario (11 feet of ocean level rise) as the primary motivator for people to accept the conclusion, which is not based on evidence or reason.

789,"The ‘ancient carbon’ of Alaska’s tundras is being released, starting a vicious warming cycle. This is ancient carbon, thousands and millions of years old. It’s being released much earlier than we thought.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of division

step 1: identifying the argument - the argument here seems to be that because ancient carbon is being released from alaska's tundras, it will cause a vicious warming cycle.

step 2: determining whether there's a claim about a part and a whole - yes, the argument suggests that since the ancient carbon is being released from a specific location (alaska's tundras), it will have an effect on a larger scale (a vicious warming cycle).

step 3: evaluating whether the claim holds true - the size of a part does not necessarily dictate the impact it has on the whole, in this case, the global climate. releasing ancient carbon from one location may have some effect, but assuming it will cause a ""vicious warming cycle"" is not supported by the premise that only some ancient carbon is being released, and not all of it at once or from every part of the earth.",False

expert 1: the claim relies on one of its premises (the weakening of the gulf stream due to melting ice caps) to support its conclusion that sea level rise is more pronounced in south florida. this creates a circle where no useful information is being shared.

expert 2: moreover, it seems there might be other factors at play causing higher sea level rise in south florida, such as subsidence or local land use changes, but these are not considered or ruled out as possible explanations.

expert 3: as a result, the argument becomes circular since we cannot determine whether the rising sea levels in south florida are due to global warming-related factors or localized issues, which further complicates any conclusion about the cause of sea level rise.",False
791,The Northern Hemisphere jet stream flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large. But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated. That’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes.,nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation (step 1 - expert 1): the statement suggests that a strong jet stream is caused by a large temperature difference, but then it states that a weakened and elongated jet stream is the result of the arctic warming up faster than the equator. if the jet stream's weakness and elongation are due to the arctic-equator temperature difference, then this difference must be large (as per the initial claim), thus creating a circular argument where the premise supports the conclusion, which in turn supports the premise.

explanation (step 2 - expert 2): the statement infers that extreme weather results from weakened and elongated jet streams. however, it does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim about the connection between the jet stream's characteristics and extreme weather.

explanation (step 3 - expert 3): the statement implies that a faster warming arctic relative to the equator leads to weakened and elongated jet streams, which then cause extreme weather. this suggests that there is a direct causal link between the temperature difference and extreme weather, but no evidence or explanation is provided for this claim.

792,"The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities.",nothing,"answer: appeal to fear

expert 1: the statement uses fear (flooding many of the world's largest cities) as a primary motivator for accepting the conclusion that the melting greenland ice sheet is a major contributor to rising sea level. there is no evidence or reason provided to justify this claim.

expert 2: however, the fear of flooding isn’t unfounded in this case since there is ample scientific evidence supporting the connection between melting ice sheets and rising sea levels. the fear here serves as a warning rather than an irrational motivation.

expert 1: even though the fear is based on some valid evidence, it still overshadows any rational discussion about the topic by making it seem like there's no room for debate or alternative viewpoints. it also creates a sense of urgency without providing specific actions to address the problem. that qualifies it as an appeal to fear fallacy.

expert 2: i concur with expert 1's reasoning, and there is nothing to add.

answer: appeal to fear",True
793,"The rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea.",nothing,"answer: appeal to authority

expert 1: the statement asserts that satellite measurements are a reliable source, which makes it an appeal to authority.

expert 2: however, the argument does not specify who these ""satellites"" are or provide any evidence of their expertise in measuring ice loss, so the appeal to authority is still flawed.

expert 3: the statement also claims that global warming is driving the observed changes in greenland's glaciers without presenting additional supporting evidence, making it an oversimplification and a weak argument.

expert 4: recognizing that expert opinions can be biased or incorrect, we should consider alternative explanations for the rapid ice loss before drawing definitive conclusions about climate change as the cause. the statement lacks balance in its reasoning and does not provide enough evidence to justify its assertions, making it an appeal to authority fallacy.",False
794,"Global warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities, but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016.",nothing,"answer: equivocation

expert 1: the term ""driven"" can be interpreted as the sole cause or the main contributor. it is not clear if the statement means that human activities are the only cause of global warming, which would make it an incorrect statement. (equivocation)

expert 2: however, the sentence does imply that human activities play a significant role in driving global warming and that el niño added to the heat in 2016. it does not suggest that human activities are the only factor contributing to global warming. (equivocation)

expert 3: furthermore, equivocation can also occur when interpreting whether ""largely"" means ""mostly,"" or ""nearly completely."" without knowing the exact percentage of global warming driven by human activities, it's possible that some readers might misinterpret the meaning of ""largely.""

795,Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called ‘sunny-day flooding’ — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years. The sea is now so near the brim in many places that they believe the problem is likely to worsen quickly.,nothing,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be an example of 'appeal to fear'. the argument is using the potential worsening of a problem (sunny-day flooding) as a reason to accept the conclusion, without providing sufficient evidence for the claim that it will get worse quickly.

step 2 (expert 2): while the appeal to fear is present, there is also an implied 'appeal to authority'. the experts who have documented this issue are being used as authorities on the matter, but their expertise in flooding and sea levels doesn't necessarily mean they can predict future events.

step 3 (expert 3): given that both fallacies are present, let's continue by considering the context and implications. the initial statement is not making a definitive claim about the future but rather expressing an opinion based on current observations. in this sense, we can say that while there is some 'circular reasoning', it doesn't meet the criteria of being a standalone fallacy since it doesn't rely solely on its own premise to support the conclusion.

step 4 (expert 1): considering the group consensus, we have found that the statement contains both 'appeal to fear' and 'implied appeal to authority'. however, upon closer examination, the reasoning does not fit the strict definitions of circular reasoning as a standalone fallacy.

answer: implied appeal to authority, appeal to fear",False
796,"The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link.",nothing,"answer: appeal to tradition

explanation step 1 (expert 1): the argument is based on a correlation between two phenomena (arctic ice melting and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere) without providing evidence that one causes the other.

explanation step 2 (expert 2): the statement suggests that because winter link has been established, the summer link should also be accepted due to tradition or precedent, not based on new evidence.

explanation step 3 (expert 3): there is no evidence provided that winter and summer links are equal in their certainty, only that one connection has been established previously. therefore, it is an appeal to tradition fallacy to infer that the summer link is probable based solely on this precedent.",False
797,"As surface temperatures of the oceans warm up, the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere. We’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods.",nothing,"initial expert: this statement seems to be using an appeal to worse problems fallacy by stating that warming ocean temperatures will lead to more floods as a way to make the scenario sound worse than it may actually be, rather than providing evidence for this claim.

second expert: however, the statement also suggests that there is a causal relationship between warming ocean temperatures and increased water vapor in the atmosphere, which could be an example of a fallacy of division if the argument infers that because there is more water vapor in the whole (the atmosphere), there will be more water vapor in each part of the system.

third expert: lastly, it's essential to note that this statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the claim that the increased water vapor in the atmosphere inherently means the system is capable of producing more floods. if there are no evidential connections being made between the increased water vapor and an increase in floods, then it's unclear if we can call this statement a fallacy or not.

final answer: nothing (as the statement does not clearly fit into any one of the described fallacies)",True
798,"We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.",nothing,"step 1: appeal to fear (there is an implied threat of increased greenhouse gas emissions and climate change if forests continue to be lost.)

answer: circular reasoning",False
799,"Over the coming 25 or 30 years, scientists say, the climate is likely to gradually warm.",nothing,"answer: fallacy of division

expert 1: the claim that the climate will gradually warm refers only to the climate as a whole, not necessarily each part of it individually.
expert 2: therefore, inferring from the change in the overall climate to smaller parts, such as individual weather events or even specific regions, is an invalid logical leap.
expert 3: this is an example of fallacy of division, where a property assumed true for the whole (the climate) is being incorrectly applied to each part (specific weather events or regions).",False
800,Some countries are already talking about banning the sale of gasoline cars after 2030.,nothing,"answer: appeal to fear

step 1 (expert 1): the statement suggests that if we don't ban the sale of gasoline cars, catastrophic events will happen. however, no evidence or reason is provided for this claim, making it a fallacy known as an appeal to fear.

step 2 (expert 2): the argument tries to scare people into accepting the conclusion without providing any facts or logic. this is indeed a type of fallacy.

step 3 (expert 3): the reasoning so far suggests that we are dealing with an appeal to fear, as the statement tries to manipulate emotions (fear) rather than presenting rational arguments for its claim. there seems to be no logical or evidence-based justification for banning gasoline cars by 2030 to avoid catastrophic events, making it a fallacy.

step 4 (expert 1, confirming the final answer): the argument makes use of fear to try and convince people to accept its conclusion without providing any evidence or reasoning, which is indeed an appeal to fear fallacy.",False
801,"In 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100. But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible.",nothing,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the argument is based on the premise that scientists reached a consensus in 2013, but now some scientists are questioning this consensus. however, this premise is being used as evidence for the conclusion that the plausible rise by 2100 might be more than three feet.

expert 2: the conclusion relies on the fact that some scientists are now contradicting the previous consensus, but the argument's validity depends on the initial consensus reached in 2013, which is being used to support the very same conclusion it was initially meant to establish.",False
802,The planet’s average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F (0.9C).,nothing,"step 1: identifying the argument being made. the argument here is that the planet's average ground temperature has risen significantly.

step 2: evaluating the evidence provided to support the claim. in this case, there is no evidence presented, only a statement of fact.

step 3: determining if the argument is based on fear or not. there is no indication that fear is being used as a primary motivator in this argument.

step 4: identifying if an alleged authority is used without justification. no apparent appeal to authority fallacy is present here.

step 5: checking for comparison to worse problems. the statement does not try to make the scenario better by comparing it to a worse case scenario, so there's no appeal to worse problems.

step 6: looking for circular reasoning. the argument does not rely on its own premise to support its conclusion, so no circular reasoning is found.

step 7: identifying guilt by association. there is no attempt to associate the claim about the planet's temperature with anything or anyone else in a negative way.

step 8: detecting appeal to anger. the statement does not include any expression of anger, hatred, or rage.

step 9: recognizing straw man fallacy. no mischaracterization or distortion of an argument is present here.

step 10: identifying appeal to tradition. there is no mention of historical preferences or past customs relevant to the claim about the planet's temperature.

step 11: checking for equivocation. the term ""significantly"" can be interpreted in different ways, but it doesn't appear that the author is deliberately trying to deceive by changing the meaning of a word or phrase without clear indication.

step 12: detecting fallacy of division. the argument does not infer that something is true of one or more parts from the fact that it is true of the whole.

step 13: identifying tu quoque. there is no attempt to distract from the claim by pointing out flaws in the one making the claim.

step 14: recognizing appeal to positive emotion. the statement does not try to manipulate emotions in a positive direction to make the argument seem reasonable, so there's no appeal to positive emotion here.

803,"Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.",nothing,"answer: appeal to authority (fallacy)
explanation (expert 1): the use of satellite data in this context implies that it is a more reliable source than tide-gauge data. however, the argument does not provide any evidence or reasoning as to why satellite data should be considered an authority on sea level measurements compared to tide-gauges, thus making it a fallacy.
explanation (expert 2): the argument assumes that satellite data is inherently superior to tide-gauge data, without justification. this assumption relies solely on the fact that it is newer technology and does not address the potential limitations or biases of each method. therefore, this is an example of an appeal to authority fallacy.
explanation (expert 3): the argument does not provide evidence as to why satellite data should be considered more accurate than tide-gauge data for measuring sea levels. it simply states that satellite data provides more precise estimates, but does not explain the reasoning behind this claim. this is an example of an appeal to authority fallacy since it relies on the assumption that newer technology is automatically superior without providing evidence to support this claim.

806,"Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.",slippery slope,"answer: appeal to tradition

1st expert: the argument is about the current state of social security, not its historical past. therefore, it does not matter if governor reagan's previous positions were based on tradition or not.

2nd expert: however, the premise that changing social security to a voluntary system would bankrupt it is based on the assumption that it has always been mandatory and will always be in the future. that assumption is rooted in tradition.

3rd expert: furthermore, the argument's conclusion is that this change should not be made because of its historical precedent, which contradicts the premise that it would be a voluntary system in the first place, as mandatory systems have always existed until now according to the tradition.",False
807,because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.,slippery slope,"step 1: appeal to fear
step 2: circular reasoning
final answer: appeal to fear (if we don’t take action as proposed, there will be economic chaos; therefore, taking action is necessary to prevent economic chaos) combined with circular reasoning (the claim relies on its own premise of economic chaos being the consequence of withdrawing government support).",False
808,"And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.",slippery slope,"answer: appeal to worse problems

expert 1: the argument is trying to make a scenario (economy of the us) better by comparing it to a worse case scenario (agricultural economy collapsing).
expert 2: however, this comparison does not justify the conclusion that if the agricultural economy collapses, then the entire u.s. economy will collapse. the two scenarios are not directly related.
expert 3: the fact that one event may have an impact on another, in this case, the agriculture sector affecting the overall economy, does not mean it will result in a complete collapse of the entire economy. the argument is making a claim without justification.",False
809,"So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.",slippery slope,"answer: fallacy of division

1st expert: the argument infers that something is true of one or more of the parts (the economy of the farmers) from the fact that it is true of the whole (the country as a whole).
2nd expert: the size of one’s economy almost certainly does not mean that the rest of the country will be affected by the same proportions. the size of the whole (country's economy) is not directly related to the size of every part of the country's economy.
3rd expert: final agreement, no need for further steps.",False
810,"The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.",slippery slope,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement seems to be an example of circular reasoning because the ""six-party talks"" are being mentioned twice, once as the initial action and once as the consequence of another action.

step 2 (expert 2): however, upon closer inspection, it appears that there is a subtle difference between the two mentions: the first mention refers to bilateral talks, while the second mention refers to six-party talks. this suggests that the author might be using equivocation.

step 3 (expert 3): the statement seems to imply that bilateral talks and six-party talks are interchangeable or equivalent, which is not necessarily true in a diplomatic context. this further supports the idea of equivocation as a fallacy being used here.

answer: equivocation",False
811,"It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate. It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.",slippery slope,"answer: circular reasoning

expert 1: the conclusion ""china no longer will be involved"" is based on the premise ""kim jong il gets rid of his weapons"", but the premise requires china's involvement for it to happen.

expert 2: however, the implication that china's involvement is crucial for kim jong il to give up weapons is not directly stated or supported by evidence.

expert 3: the argument assumes that if china withdraws from convincing kim jong il, then he will definitely not get rid of his weapons, but this assumption lacks justification and supporting evidence.

answer: circular reasoning",False
812,"And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.",slippery slope,"answer: appeal to positive emotion

expert 1: the argument tries to manipulate emotions to a positive direction to make it seem reasonable.

expert 2: the conclusion is not supported by any substantial evidence or reasoning.

answer: nothing (since both experts agree on the fallacy type)",False
813,"Now, you're -- and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money.",slippery slope,"answer: appeal to fear

explanation (step 1): the statement implies that a catastrophic consequence will occur if the plan is not followed - ""the kids would be trapped there for another three years"". this creates an atmosphere of fear which may cause people to overlook potential flaws in the argument.

explanation (step 2): there is no evidence provided to support the claim that the kids would indeed be ""trapped"" if the plan is not followed, resulting in a lack of justification for the fear-based premise.

explanation (step 3): since there is no valid reason or evidence given to back up the dire consequences stated in the argument, it can be concluded that the statement falls under the appeal to fear fallacy category.",False
814,It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.,slippery slope,"this statement is an example of the ""appeal to fear"" fallacy.

explanation: the argument relies on the fear of a collapsed economy as the primary motivator for accepting the conclusion, but there is no evidence or reason provided for the claim that raising taxes and making cuts will lead to such an outcome.",False
815,"If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children.",slippery slope,"answer: appeal to fear

expert 1: the argument is trying to motivate people to vote for someone by using fear as a primary motivator (i.e., ""we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the president representing education in our children""). this is an appeal to fear fallacy because there is no evidence or reason provided to justify this fear.

expert 2: the argument is based on a premise that if someone gets elected president, it will directly result in something happening in the future (i.e., ""we'll start the new century""). this is not necessarily true, as many factors can influence the presidency and its cabinet appointments over the course of a single term, let alone an entire century.

expert 3: the argument does not provide any evidence or reason to suggest that having someone in the cabinet who represents education for children is essential to maintaining that representation over the course of an entire century. this is an example of the fallacy of division, as the fact that one part (a single term) may be true, does not necessarily mean it will be true for the whole (an entire century).

answer: answer: fallacy of division and appeal to fear",False
816,"When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.",slippery slope,"answer: appeal to fear

1st expert: the argument presents a possible future scenario (the federal government setting standards and telling teachers what to teach) and suggests that it would be bad, without providing any evidence or reason for why it would be bad. this is an example of an appeal to fear fallacy.

2nd expert: the argument does not provide any evidence or reasoning beyond the claim that having the federal government pay teachers will lead to them setting standards and telling teachers what to teach. this is another example of an appeal to fear fallacy, as the argument relies on an unfounded assumption that this would be a negative outcome.

3rd expert: the argument does not provide any evidence or reasoning beyond the claim that having the federal government pay teachers will lead to them setting standards and telling teachers what to teach. this is an example of an appeal to fear fallacy, as the argument relies on an unfounded assumption that this would be a negative outcome, without providing any evidence or reasoning for why it would be bad for the country or teaching profession. the argument does not make clear that it is based on fear, but rather presents a negative future scenario without providing justification or evidence. this can be interpreted as an implicit appeal to fear fallacy.

answer: implicit appeal to fear",False
817,The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.,slippery slope,answer: appeal to fear,False

820,If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped. That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.,slippery slope,"step 1: appeal to fear
step 2: circular reasoning (if mr. ford's policy leads to atomic weapons, then assuming his policy without questioning it reinforces the premise)
final answer: answer: appeal to fear and circular reasoning",False
821,"He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation .  Now, here's what that means .  It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented .  And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country .",slippery slope,"this statement appears to be an example of 'appeal to fear'. the reasoning is that the speaker is using the fear of a massive law enforcement operation and potential deportations as a primary motivator for the audience to accept the idea that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. however, there is no evidence or reason provided to justify this claim, making it a fallacy.

the first expert might think: 'this statement appears to use fear as a primary motivator to accept an idea without justification.'

the second expert might think: 'there is no supporting evidence or reason provided for the claim that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation, making it a fallacy of appeal to fear.'

the final answer: 'answer: appeal to fear'",False
822,"that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.

824,"This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.",slippery slope,"step 1: appeal to fear (the statement uses the potential danger of ""going into the star wars system"" as a reason for why it's a bad idea, but there is no evidence or justification provided for this claim.)

step 2: nothing (there is no further reasoning needed as the initial classification has already been made and there is no need to classify it as another fallacy.)

answer: appeal to fear",False
825,"Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary. Here … are just some of the charts to prove it.",strawman,"the fallacy in this statement is ""appeal to false authority"". the reasoning goes as follows:

1. expert a: recognizes that the source of information (the charts) is being used as evidence in an argument, but questions whether the charts are truly reliable authorities on the issue of global warming.
2. expert b: agrees with expert a, noting that the charts themselves do not have the expertise or credibility to make definitive claims about global warming.
3. expert c: recognizes that the argument is implying that these charts are an authority on the topic of global warming, but they lack the necessary qualifications to be considered experts in this field. therefore, the argument is using false authorities as evidence for its claim.

answer: appeal to false authority",False
826,"The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever. Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.”",strawman,"answer: appeal to emotion (appeal to positive emotion)

1st expert: the statement is trying to make the argument apparent by appealing to a positive direction to make the argument seem reasonable.
2nd expert: the argument tries to distract from the truth of the conclusion by using emotions, rather than giving substantial evidence in favor of the claim that co2 is a pollutant.
3rd expert: there is no evidence provided for the claim that co2 is a pollutant. the emotional appeal serves as a distraction from the lack of evidence and reasoning in the argument.",False
827,those who don’t want to say ‘Merry Christmas’ or use Christmas decorations are inherently anti-Christian.,strawman,"answer: guilt by association

1st expert: the statement equates not saying ""merry christmas"" with being anti-christian, which implies that someone who does not do so is associated with being against christianity.
2nd expert: the argument assumes that the act of not participating in christmas celebrations directly reflects one's religious beliefs and affiliation, which may not be accurate.
3rd expert: the statement ignores the possibility that there could be many reasons for someone not saying ""merry christmas,"" such as personal preference or cultural differences, that do not necessarily relate to their religious views.",False
828,People who want to lower sentences for drug offenses must want children to be running around doing drugs.,strawman,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to fear fallacy - the argument is using the fear of children doing drugs as a primary motivator to support the claim that lowering sentences for drug offenses is dangerous, without providing evidence or reason for this connection.

step 2 (expert 2): nothing - the argument does not contain any other fallacies discussed in the list provided.

step 3 (expert 3): nothing - there are no additional fallacies present in the argument.

answer: appeal to fear",False
829,"All vegans are opposed to animal captivity, including pet ownership.",strawman,"answer: guilt by association

expert 1: the argument is equating all vegans with pet owners, which is a group that may include many people who are not vegan.
expert 2: however, the argument assumes that being a vegan means one is against all forms of animal captivity, including pets, which may not be the case for some vegans.
expert 3: the conclusion is based on a negative connotation associated with pet owners, leading to an unfair stereotype of vegans as a whole.",False
830,"I submit to you that if you can't take this evidence and find these defendants guilty on this evidence then we might as well open all the banks and say, Come on and get the money, boys, because we'll never be able to convict them.",strawman,answer: appeal to fear,False
831,Those who advocate for environmental protection are clearly against progress and economic development.,strawman,"answer: appeal to false authority / guilt by association

1st expert: this statement suggests that all advocates for environmental protection can be grouped with those against progress and economic development. however, this is a fallacy of equivocation as the term ""environmental protection"" is being used ambiguously, encompassing both those who want to hinder progress and those who simply wish to protect and conserve resources sustainably for future generations.

2nd expert: additionally, this statement assumes that environmentalists are not also proponents of economic development, which is a guilt by association fallacy since it implies all environmentalists are anti-progress without evidence or justification. the argument oversimplifies the complex relationship between economic growth and sustainable resource management.

3rd expert: lastly, the implication that environmental protection is against progress is an appeal to false authority, as no credible source supports this assertion and it goes against a wealth of scientific research demonstrating that sustainability can drive innovation and foster long-term prosperity.",False
832,You think that we should invest more in education? You must be suggesting that we throw unlimited funds at schools without any accountability or oversight.,strawman,"answer: straw man fallacy

1st expert: the arguer is presenting an extreme position, ""unlimited funds"", which was not the original claim about investing more in education.
2nd expert: the arguer has misrepresented the original argument by implying that it suggests unchecked spending without oversight or accountability.
3rd expert: the original argument did not suggest throwing money indiscriminately at schools, but rather increasing investment in education. the counterargument created a distorted version of the position.",False
833,"My daughter's teacher says her class needs to spend more time on math tasks, she clearly doesn’t care about literacy subjects.",strawman,"answer: guilt by association

expert 1: the reasoning is that the teacher does not prioritize literacy subjects because she is associated with not caring about them. (guilt by association)

expert 2: however, we cannot assume that because a person neglects one area, they necessarily neglect all areas. we need to consider the possibility that the teacher may still value literacy subjects but finds it more urgent to focus on math at this time. (equivocation, circular reasoning)

expert 3: the claim is based on the assumption that if a teacher does not prioritize one subject, then they do not care about it. this is not necessarily true as teachers may need to prioritize different subjects for various reasons. it's possible that the teacher values literacy subjects but has other objectives or circumstances that require more attention in math at this time. (appeal to tradition, false authority)

expert 4: in conclusion, it seems that the argument is based on guilt by association, assuming that if a teacher neglects one subject, they do not care about it. however, there are other factors to consider when assessing the value a teacher places on different subjects. (circular reasoning, straw man fallacy)

expert 5: let us remember that teachers often have to make difficult decisions regarding resource allocation and may prioritize certain subjects based on immediate needs or upcoming assessments. this does not necessarily indicate a lack of value for the other subjects. we should avoid making assumptions about the teacher's intentions without understanding their context. (fallacy of division, ad hominem)

expert 6: lastly, we must also keep in mind that a teacher's priorities may shift over time and this assessment might only reflect a temporary situation rather than an enduring lack of interest or concern for literacy subjects. (appeal to pity, hasty generalization)

answer: guilt by association",False
834,Democrats want to spend more money on the social safety net. They are obviously communist.,strawman,"step 1 (expert a): guilt by association - the argument uses an association between democrats and a group (communists) that is viewed negatively to make a conclusion about democrats.

step 2 (expert b): nothing - this step does not seem to use any of the defined fallacies listed, but it could be argued that there is no conclusion being made. however, since there seems to be an attempt to make a conclusion based on association, it could also be considered as guilt by association.

step 3 (expert c): nothing - while democrats wanting to spend more money on the social safety net does not necessarily mean they are communists, it can be argued that this argument is attempting to draw a conclusion without providing evidence or reasoning, which fits the definition of circular reasoning if one assumes that wanting to spend more money on the social safety net is inherently communist. however, since there seems to be no explicit reference to circular reasoning in the statement, it could also be considered as nothing.

step 4 (expert a and b): appeal to association - both experts agree that the argument uses an association between democrats and a group (communists) viewed negatively to make a conclusion about democrats. however, since there seems to be no explicit reference to circular reasoning in the statement, they decide not to classify it as such.

step 5 (expert c): nothing - since all experts have now come to an agreement that the argument uses an association between democrats and a group (communists) viewed negatively to make a conclusion about democrats, they do not need to continue their analysis.

answer: guilt by association",False
835,My friend says that he thinks he’s going to vote for the Republicans because he thinks they have a better stance on immigration. He is racist for even considering it.,strawman,"step 1 (expert 1): ad hominem fallacy - the argument focuses not on the merits of the position, but on attacking the person who holds it, here by labeling him as 'racist'.

step 2 (expert 2): no need to proceed further. the first expert's response correctly identifies the error in reasoning.

answer: ad hominem fallacy",False
836,I heard someone mention that they think we should add more security cameras because of the thefts in the building. They clearly don't trust their neighbors.,strawman,answer: appeal to fear,False
837,My mom won't let me go to the party. Why does she hate me?,strawman,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of the guilt by association fallacy. the mother is being associated with hating the speaker because she has denied them permission to attend a party, which is not evidence that she holds malicious feelings towards the speaker.

step 2 (expert 2): the argument also appears to rely on the appeal to anger fallacy. the speaker is expressing strong negative emotions (anger) in place of presenting rational evidence to support their claim.

step 3 (expert 3): there is no logical reasoning or evidence provided to establish a connection between the mother's decision and her supposed hatred for the speaker. the argument is missing an essential link, which makes it fallacious.

answer: guilt by association, appeal to anger, nothing (since all experts have reached the same conclusion)",False
838,My boss says that I need to make more of an effort to turn up to work on time. Why must everyone discriminate against parents.,strawman,"answer: appeal to anger

explanation (step 1): the statement implies that the speaker is angry because they are being asked to make more of an effort to be on time. they are using this anger to question why everyone else seems to be discriminating against parents, when in fact, no such discrimination has been shown or implied.

explanation (step 2): the argument assumes that being a parent is the reason for being late, which may not always be the case. therefore, the statement is an emotional appeal, not based on evidence or reasoning.

explanation (step 3): there is no evidence provided to support the claim that everyone is discriminating against parents. the argument relies solely on the speaker's anger and frustration.

explanation (final agreement): the statement uses emotional manipulation (appeal to anger) as a substitute for evidence in an attempt to make the argument seem reasonable, which makes it a fallacy.",False
839,"Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor. CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals”",strawman,"answer: appeal to fear

expert 1: the statement starts by stating that unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide is odorless, colorless, which may lead some people to think it's harmless or not a concern.
expert 2: the statement then goes on to say that every human being exhales about two pounds of co2 a day, which could be used as a fear tactic implying that we are contributing significantly to carbon emissions, potentially causing alarm or fear without providing evidence for its negative impacts.
expert 3: the statement also mentions that co2 is nontoxic to people and animals, but this information does not address the potential harm it can cause when emitted in large quantities, which is the main concern regarding co2. thus, by omitting any discussion of the negative environmental consequences, it relies on fear as a primary motivator for the reader to accept the conclusion that co2 emissions are not harmful.",False
840,The teacher’s union argues that teachers should get a 4% pay rise. The school district says it can only afford 2.5%. The school district doesn’t care about quality education.,strawman,"answer: tu quoque

step 1 (expert 1): the school district is stating that they cannot afford the teacher's demand for a 4% pay rise, but at the same time, they are not providing a pay rise to teachers which could be seen as contradicting their claim about caring about quality education.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it is not necessarily accurate that the inability to afford a pay rise implies a lack of care for quality education. the school district might have other financial obligations or constraints that are limiting their ability to offer a higher pay rise.

step 3 (expert 1): in this case, the argument about caring for quality education is being used as a counterargument against the demand for a 4% pay rise, which implies that if they don't grant the raise, it means they don't care about education. this is a fallacy of tu quoque because the school district is accused of not caring about education based on their financial decisions rather than on the actual actions or policies related to quality education.",False
841,"Americans are so patriotic, they must think they're better than everyone else.",strawman,"step 1 (expert 1): appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to pride)
step 2 (expert 2): the statement does not claim that americans believe they are superior to everyone else, but rather makes an assumption based on their patriotism.
step 3 (expert 3): even if it were true that being very patriotic could lead someone to think they're better than others, the conclusion that all americans think so is a generalization and not necessarily accurate.
step 4 (expert 1): correct, but let us be clear that we are discussing fallacies here, and the reasoning behind this statement constitutes an appeal to emotion.
answer: appeal to emotion",False
842,"My dad says we won't go on holiday this year, he must not want me to have any fun.",strawman,answer: appeal to anger,False
843,My wife was on a phone call for work while I was unpacking the dishwasher. She asked me to keep the noise down while she’s on the phone. She never appreciates my cleaning.,strawman,"step 1 (expert a): this statement appears to be an example of 'appeal to anger'. the arguer is allowing their emotions to cloud their reasoning and justify a conclusion that may not be valid, in this case, the wife's lack of appreciation for cleaning.

step 2 (expert b): the statement also contains elements of 'guilt by association'. by connecting the act of asking the husband to keep noise down with not appreciating his efforts, the wife is being painted as ungrateful, without justification.

step 3 (expert c): additionally, there seems to be an assumption that the wife's request to keep the noise down and her perceived lack of appreciation are directly related, which could be seen as 'circular reasoning'. if the husband interprets his cleaning as an act of love or respect, he may feel entitled to make noise while she is on a call without considering her professional needs.

step 4 (expert a): the statement appears to contain 'equivocation' as well. by equating keeping the noise down with not appreciating cleaning efforts, the arguer is using the phrase ""appreciate"" in two different ways: to refer both to a specific action and an emotional response.

step 5 (all experts agree): answer: circular reasoning",False
844,My husband says these pants make me look slim. He must think I look fat in the other ones.,strawman,"step 1 (expert 1): this statement appears to be an example of guilt by association fallacy. the argument is that because one type of clothing (the other ones) makes the person look fat, any clothing that does not make them look slim must therefore make them look fat.

step 2 (expert 2): however, it could also be argued that this is an example of circular reasoning fallacy. the assumption is that if a husband thinks one type of pants makes the person look fat, then any other type of pants that he doesn't think makes them look slim must therefore make them look slim. but the claim relies on its own premise (i.e., the husband's opinion) to support both its conclusion and its premise, creating a circular argument.

step 3 (expert 3): considering both points, it seems that the statement could be an example of either guilt by association or circular reasoning fallacy, or possibly even both in combination. since we are looking for a final agreement on one classification, let us first rule out 'nothing' as an answer.

step 4 (all experts): after discussion and analysis, it is agreed that the statement can be classified as circular reasoning fallacy since the argument relies on its own premise (the husband's opinion) to support both its conclusion and its premise, creating a circular argument. therefore, the final answer would be: answer: circular reasoning fallacy.",False
845,"A law was proposed that in 10 years, all vehicles should be electric powered. This is a war on the weekend - how will I take long weekend rides anymore?",strawman,answer: appeal to fear,False
