**explanation:** the statement suggests that the existence of god can be inferred from the fact that many intelligent people believe in him. this relies on the authority of the experts to establish the truth of the claim. however, the argument does not consider the possibility that the experts are simply mistaken or that their beliefs are based on cultural or psychological factors rather than objective evidence.",False

**explanation:** the premise suggests that the negative environmental effects of renewables must necessarily outweigh the benefits of renewable energy simply because those negative effects exist. however, this ignores the fact that renewable energy sources such as wind turbines also have positive environmental benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. the argument commits the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy by assuming that because a (renewable energy) is associated with b (negative environmental effects), then a must be worse than other options.",False
367,"Like countless other organisms, we move and adapt when the environment changes. Species thrive when it is warm.",false analogy,"**answer:** answer: circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise implies that the experts will change their minds if they realize they are wrong. however, the premise itself relies on the assumption that the experts will change their minds if they realize they are wrong. this creates a circular reasoning where the conclusion (experts must reach an agreement) is supported by the premise (experts will change their minds if they realize they are wrong), which in turn is supported by the conclusion.",False

**explanation:** the premise assumes that the experts' authority is automatically accepted as valid simply because they are experts, without any assessment of the quality of their reasoning or the soundness of their conclusions.",False
377,To say humans are immortal is like saying a car can run forever.,false analogy,"**answer:** circular reasoning

**explanation:** the argument assumes that if three experts disagree at any point during the classification process, they must ultimately reach an agreement, which is not necessarily true. the circular reasoning arises from the premise that if the experts can agree on one step, they can move on to the next step, and so on, until they reach an agreement, without considering the possibility that they may never reach an agreement.",False

**explanation:** the argument assumes that just as biological bodies naturally decline with age and eventually cease to function, political bodies will inevitably follow the same fate. however, this ignores the fundamental difference between biological bodies and political bodies. political bodies are complex social constructs with diverse compositions, functions, and ideologies that are not directly analogous to the biological processes of aging and death in individual organisms.",False

**explanation:** the argument assumes that the process of using antibiotics or pesticides will inevitably lead to the development of resistance, without providing any evidence or data to support this claim. the argument then concludes that because resistance can develop, these measures should not be used. however, the premise itself relies on the conclusion that resistance will develop, creating a circular reasoning structure where no useful information is added to the argument.",False

**explanation:** the statement suggests that the increase in bugs is directly due to the cessation of daylight saving time (dst). however, this ignores other possible factors that could contribute to the abundance of bugs, such as weather patterns, habitat changes, or population growth among insects. the statement commits a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy by assuming that the change in behavior (stopping dst) caused the subsequent event (increased bug population).",False

400,Ever since I started wearing this crystal necklace I’ve been extremely lucky. I’ve even aced all my exams. This necklace is my lucky charm.,false causality,"**answer:** appeal to anecdotal evidence.

**explanation:** the statement relies on personal anecdotes (the writer's own experiences after wearing the necklace) to support the claim that the necklace is a lucky charm. however, anecdotal evidence is not sufficient to establish a casual relationship between the necklace and the writer's success. the writer's experience may be unique or not representative of the experiences of others.",False
401,I swear every time I wash my car it rains the next day. It's like the universe is playing a prank on me. I'd better not wash my car the day before we go to the beach.,false causality,"**answer:** circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise implies that every time someone washes their car, it rains the next day, so if they don't wash their car the day before going to the beach, it won't rain. however, this relies on the previous premise, creating a circular reasoning argument where neither premise actually proves the conclusion.",False
402,So I moved my furniture around last week and wouldn't you know it - I got a promotion at work. Maybe I should become an interior decorator.,false causality,"**answer:** appeal to causality

**explanation:** the argument assumes that because changing the furniture arrangement led to a promotion, the rearrangement itself caused the promotion. this overlooks other possible factors that could have contributed to the promotion, such as improved work performance or changes in the company's hiring practices.",False
403,Since I switched to drinking green tea my skin has cleared up. It's like nature's cure for acne.,false causality,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**explanation:** the premise of the argument is that green tea cures acne, and the conclusion is that the premise is true because it has been shown to work. this creates a circular argument where the premise is supported by itself, rather than by any external evidence.",False
404,I prayed for good weather for my outdoor event and it didn't rain. My prayers must have caused the clear skies.,false causality,"**answer:** appeal to confirmation bias.

**explanation:** the statement assumes that the experts' initial hypotheses are correct simply because they all agree on them at the end. this ignores the possibility that the experts simply adjusted their hypotheses based on the information they encountered during the process of classification, rather than any supernatural intervention.",False
405,I saw a shooting star and made a wish and it came true. As if I needed more proof that shooting stars grant wishes.,false causality,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**explanation:** the premise of the argument is that if any expert realizes they are wrong at any point, they will leave the group. this means that the experts are obligated to change their minds when presented with evidence that contradicts their initial hypotheses. this undermines the ability of the experts to reach a genuine consensus, as their willingness to change their minds is dependent on the opinions of others rather than objective evidence.",False
406,I listened to classical music while studying and I got a high score on the test. Classical music must improve academic performance.,false causality,"**answer:** circular reasoning

**explanation:** the argument assumes that because classical music was associated with a high score on the test, it therefore improves academic performance. however, this ignores the many other factors that could have contributed to the high score, such as the student's hard work, study habits, or the difficulty of the test.",False

**reasoning:** 
- the premise suggests that the flu shot directly caused covid-19.
- however, the argument ignores the multiple factors that can contribute to contracting covid-19, such as exposure to the virus, underlying health conditions, and other environmental factors.
- the argument unfairly simplifies the complex cause of covid-19 by attributing it solely to the flu shot.",False
409,I tested positive for COVID-19 after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine must have caused me to get infected.,false causality,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**explanation:** the argument assumes that because the vaccine was recently received, it must be the cause of the covid-19 infection. however, this ignores other possible factors that could have caused the infection, such as exposure to the virus from other sources.",False
410,I wore a mask and still got COVID-19. Masks must not be effective in preventing transmission.,false causality,"**answer:** answer: circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise assumes that the mask-wearing experts are correct until they reach an agreement, which means that their initial premise is based on the assumption that the experts will eventually agree with them. this creates a circular reasoning where the premise is supported by the conclusion, and the conclusion is supported by the premise.",False
411,I took zinc supplements and didn't get COVID-19. Zinc must be the key to immunity against the virus.,false causality,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**explanation:** the argument assumes that because some experts initially classified the effectiveness of zinc supplements based on their limited understanding, that their conclusion must eventually become accurate as more experts join the discussion and review the evidence. this ignores the fact that new information, evidence, and expert opinions can change over time, and that the initial classification may need to be revisited and revised based on new findings.",False

413,Every severe recession follows a Republican Presidency; therefore Republicans are the cause of recessions.,false causality,"**answer: straw man**

**reasoning:** 
- the argument conflates the correlation between republican presidencies and recessions with the causation. 
- the premise suggests that republican presidencies alone are responsible for all severe recessions, ignoring other factors that contribute to economic downturns.
- the argument misrepresents the complex economic factors that cause recessions, attributing them solely to the political party in office.",False
414,“But like most claims regarding global warming the real effect is small and most likely due to natural weather patterns. Any changes in hurricanes over 70 years can easily be part of natural cycles — or incomplete data. Coastal lake sediments along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from 1000 to 2000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today.,false causality,"**answer:** appeal to natural cycles and incomplete data.

**explanation:** the statement suggests that the observed increase in hurricane frequency and intensity over the past 70 years is simply part of natural weather patterns and that the available data is incomplete. this is a fallacy because:

- the statement relies on the assumption that natural weather patterns remain constant over time, which is not necessarily true.
- the statement ignores the significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions over the past 70 years, which is widely accepted by the scientific community to be a major factor in the observed increase in hurricane frequency and intensity.",False
415,I drank bottled water and now I am sick. The water must have made me sick.,false causality,"**answer:** appeal to hasty generalization

417,After the introduction of 5G technology there was a sudden increase in reported cases of COVID-19. 5G technology must be causing the virus.,false causality,"**answer:** answer: post hoc ergo propter hoc.

**explanation:** the statement assumes that the introduction of 5g technology caused the sudden increase in reported cases of covid-19, simply because the increase occurred after the introduction of the technology. this overlooks other possible factors that could have contributed to the rise in cases, such as changes in testing or behavior during the pandemic.",False
418,Vaccines cause autism - there was a rise in autism diagnoses following the release of a new vaccine.,false causality,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**explanation:** 
- the premise assumes a correlation between vaccine release and autism diagnosis without considering other factors that may have contributed to the rise in autism diagnoses. 
- the statement relies on its own premise (vaccines cause autism) to support the conclusion that there is a correlation between vaccines and autism. 
- the argument circles back to its premise without providing any additional evidence or reasoning to establish a casual relationship between the two.",False
419,The occurrence of natural disasters coincides with military exercises or operations in certain regions. These disasters must be caused by covert military actions.,false causality,"**answer: straw man**

**explanation:** the correlation between the introduction of gmo foods and the increase in cancer cases does not necessarily mean that gmo foods cause cancer. 

the argument overlooks other possible factors that could contribute to the rise in cancer cases, such as changes in diet, lifestyle, or medical practices. 

the argument commits the fallacy of hasty generalization by drawing a definitive conclusion (gmo foods cause cancer) based on a correlation between the introduction of gmo foods and an increase in cancer cases without considering other potential causes of the increase.",False
422,The discovery of ancient artifacts coincides with mysterious disappearances or accidents. Therefore these artifacts must be cursed or possessed.,false causality,"**answer: nothing**

the premise lacks logical connection between the discovery of ancient artifacts and the mysterious disappearances or accidents. the argument does not establish a casual relationship between the two events.",False
423,"I would never hurt a puppy nor ask anyone else to. Pets are not used in animal testing. Again, would you save a diseased rat over yourself?",false dilemma,"**answer:** circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise implies that the experts will continue the process until they reach an agreement, meaning their initial conclusions are contingent on the outcome of the process itself. this undermines the validity of their initial assumptions and conclusions.",False
424,Testing on animals could save the life of you or a family member. Do you really think the life of your child is less important than a mouse?,false dilemma,"**answer:** appeal to compassion.

428,Be my friend or be my enemy.,false dilemma,"**answer:** circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise assumes that if any expert realizes they are wrong at any point, they will leave the group. this implies that the group can never reach a final agreement because no expert will ever be completely confident in their initial assumptions. however, this is not a valid premise. experts can change their minds based on new evidence or arguments presented by others. therefore, the argument is based on a faulty premise and is a circular reasoning.",False
429,Are you a Republican or a Democrat?,false dilemma,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**reasoning:** the argument relies on its own premise (i.e., the experts will leave if they realize they're wrong) to support its conclusion that the experts must come to a final agreement. however, this premise is circular because it simply restates the conclusion. in other words, the argument assumes that the experts will agree because they all realize they're wrong, but this is just another way of saying that the experts must agree in order for the argument to be valid.",False

432,"Since there is nothing good on TV tonight, I will just have to get drunk.",false dilemma,"**answer: straw man**

**reasoning:** the premise suggests that the experts' conclusions will be influenced by their willingness to leave if they realize they're wrong. this undermines the independence and objectivity of the experts' reasoning, as they are incentivized to conform to the group's opinion rather than arrive at their own conclusions based on the evidence. this creates a situation where the final agreement is not necessarily based on a thorough and unbiased evaluation of the facts.",False
433,"Obviously great mathematicians are born, and not made. John had all the best opportunities and is only mediocre at math. But Kara was good at math from the beginning.",false dilemma,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**explanation:** the argument assumes that the experts will reach an agreement based on their initial steps of thinking, even if they realize they are wrong at any point. this is a circular reasoning fallacy because the conclusion (agreement) depends on the premise (initial steps), which in turn depends on the conclusion.",False
434,"On the quad, I see the jocks in one corner, the rebels in another, and the intellectual set in yet another. Which one of these groups do you hang out with?",false dilemma,"**answer:** appeal to groupthink

437,"Use our fertilizer, or your crops will wither.",false dilemma,"**answer:** answer: confirmation bias

**explanation:** 
the statement suggests that if people use the company's fertilizer, their crops will be successful, and if they don't, their crops will fail. this implies that the company's fertilizer is superior and essential for successful farming. however, this argument ignores other factors that can influence crop yield, such as weather, soil conditions, and farming practices. confirmation bias is a cognitive bias where people selectively interpret information to confirm existing beliefs or hypotheses.",False
438,5 out of 7 doctors recommend this medication over its direct competitor.,false dilemma,"**answer:** appeal to authority.

733,The world’s alpine glaciers recorded a net annual loss of ice for the 36th consecutive year and the Greenland ice sheet experienced melting over more than 50% of its surface.,nothing,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**explanation:** the premise of the argument is that the experts will continue classifying until they reach an agreement, even if they realize they are wrong at any point. this implies that the experts' conclusions are based on their willingness to continue the classification process rather than on any objective evidence or reasoning. this is a circular reasoning fallacy because the conclusion (agreement) is used to support the premise (continuation of the classification process), rather than the other way around.",False
734,"These facts are completely supported by 4,000 ocean floats.",nothing,"**answer:** appeal to authority

**reasoning:** the argument assumes that the agreement of the three experts is definitive and reliable, simply because they are experts. however, this ignores the possibility that the experts could be wrong or that their conclusions might change if presented with different evidence or perspectives.",False

**explanation:** the argument assumes that the agreement of three experts is definitive and authoritative, regardless of the quality of their reasoning or the limitations of their expertise. in reality, expert opinion can be wrong, and consensus among experts does not guarantee the correctness of a conclusion.",False
737,"We have known for decades that increasing CO2 and precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century, it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent.",nothing,"**answer: nothing**

the premise that increasing co2 and precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener is not necessarily true. the statement lacks sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this claim.",True
738,"Because the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically, the continued existence of the world's great coastal cities — Miami, New York, Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica's fate.",nothing,"**answer:** circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise assumes that the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet will raise the sea level dramatically, and the conclusion is that the continued existence of the world’s great coastal cities is tied to antarctica’s fate. however, the premise itself relies on the conclusion that the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet will raise the sea level dramatically.",False

**explanation:** the statement suggests that the warm weather is the cause of the drought due to the correlation between the warm weather and the drought. however, this ignores other possible factors that could contribute to the drought, such as natural climate variations or human activities. the statement commits the fallacy of argument from coincidence, where a correlation between two events is mistakenly taken as proof of a casual relationship.",False
740,Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic's summer sea-ice cover.,nothing,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**explanation:** the argument assumes that the experts will correctly identify when they are wrong, and that they will all eventually agree on a final conclusion. this ignores the possibility that the experts may be biased, or that they may simply disagree with each other. the argument does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the claim that the experts will reach a consensus, apart from the fact that they will all leave if they realize they are wrong.",False
741,"At the bottom of the world, sea ice is also at all-time record low levels around Antarctica, the data center said. The lack of ice in the Antarctic, where it is currently summer, is most pronounced in the Amundsen Sea, where only a few scattered patches of ice remain.",nothing,"**answer:** circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise of the argument is that if any expert realizes they are wrong at any point, they will leave the group. this premise undermines the argument because it implies that the experts' conclusions are not based on solid evidence or reasoning, but rather on their willingness to conform to the group. this creates a circular reasoning where the conclusion (agreement) is supported by the premise (experts leaving if they realize they are wrong), which in turn is supported by the conclusion (agreement).",False

explanation: the argument suggests that the worst-case scenario of rising sea levels should be taken seriously, even though the experts acknowledge that their analysis is still rough. this is an appeal to the worst-case scenario fallacy, which involves exaggerating the likelihood or severity of a negative outcome to make it seem more likely or serious than it actually is.",False
743,"An inherent bias in scientific journals in favor of more calamitous predictions has excluded research showing that marine creatures are not damaged by ocean acidification, which is caused by the sea absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",nothing,"**answer:** appeal to selective observation.

**explanation:** the premise suggests that scientific journals selectively bias their publications towards more catastrophic predictions, leading to the exclusion of research indicating that marine creatures are not affected by ocean acidification. this implies that the observed pattern of ocean acidification damage among marine creatures is due to the selective publication of such research. however, this overlooks other potential factors that could influence the damage caused by ocean acidification, such as the diversity of marine creatures and the varying degrees of their susceptibility to this environmental change.",False
744,"The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century. The risk is that the rate will increase still more. Scientists who study the Earth's history say waters could rise by a foot per decade in a worst-case scenario, though that looks unlikely.

**explanation:** the argument assumes that if multiple experts independently arrive at the same conclusion after a series of steps, then the conclusion must be correct. this ignores the possibility that the experts are simply following the conclusions of previous experts, rather than independently reaching them through rigorous reasoning.",False
759,The blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted downwards to make it cooler; the red bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer.,nothing,"**answer:** circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise requires the experts to adjust the temperature data in a certain way until they reach an agreement. however, the premise itself is based on the assumption that the experts will eventually reach an agreement, which is circular reasoning. the argument assumes that the experts' conclusions will be valid simply because they eventually agree on them, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support the claim that their conclusions are actually valid.",False

**explanation:** the premise of the argument is that federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in nuisance flooding. the conclusion of the argument is that the problem is likely to worsen quickly. the premise is based on the conclusion, and the conclusion is based on the premise, creating a circular reasoning argument.",False
796,"The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link.",nothing,"**answer: nothing**

the given statement describes a hypothetical experiment involving multiple experts reaching a consensus through an iterative process. this scenario does not relate to any logical fallacy as it describes a hypothetical methodological process rather than an argument or conclusion based on flawed reasoning.",True
797,"As surface temperatures of the oceans warm up, the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere. We’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods.",nothing,"**answer:** circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise itself relies on the conclusion that more water vapor in the atmosphere will result in more floods. the argument is circular because it uses the very conclusion it is trying to prove as an assumption in the premise.",False
798,"We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.",nothing,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**reasoning:** the argument assumes that the ongoing deforestation will continue at the same rate as in the past. however, this premise is not supported by any evidence or analysis of future deforestation patterns. the argument thereby commits a circular reasoning fallacy, as it relies on its own premise to support its conclusion.",False

**explanation:** the premise of the argument is that if experts can agree on a conclusion after discussing and refining their steps, then that conclusion must be true. however, this ignores the fact that consensus is often reached through a process of negotiation and compromise, rather than a logical analysis of the evidence. this circular reasoning fallacy is often used to justify conclusions that the arguer has already decided upon.",False
802,The planet’s average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F (0.9C).,nothing,"**answer: circular reasoning**

**reasoning:** the argument relies on its own premise (i.e., the planet’s average ground temperature has risen) to support its conclusion that the experts must eventually agree on that premise. however, the premise itself is based on the argument.",False

810,"The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.",slippery slope,"**answer:** answer: circular reasoning

**explanation:** the premise implies that the experts will agree once they’ve shared their thinking steps. this means that the final agreement is simply a rephrasing of the initial premise, rather than a genuine conclusion reached through reasoning.",False

**explanation:** the premise of the argument is that if a group of experts were to collaborate and each one could potentially leave if they realized they were wrong, they would eventually reach an agreement. this premise is circular because it relies on the very idea of reaching an agreement to support itself. the argument essentially says that an agreement can only be reached if everyone agrees, which is the definition of an agreement.",False
820,If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped.
