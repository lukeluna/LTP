let's assume the experts would disagree and try to justify their stance by providing reasons. here's how they might progress through their thinking:

expert a: the statement suggests that marijuana has medicinal benefits. if marijuana is proven by scientific research to have positive effects on health, it should be allowed as a medical drug.

expert b: but what about the long-term negative effects of marijuana use? it can lead to addiction and mental health problems, which outweigh any potential benefits.

564,Drug testing athletes is justified.,nothing,"answer: nothing (this statement presents no fallacy if it's a straightforward argument without any biases, assumptions, or logical flaws.)

(assuming the experts continue with their analysis and find potential flaws)

the drug testing of athletes may not be universally fair due to unequal resources and access to prohibited substances among different countries.
  answer: hasty generalization (the statement assumes that all drug-testing procedures are inherently unfair without considering individual cases, specific situations, or possible exceptions.)

even if one athlete uses performance-enhancing drugs, it does not mean every athlete in the competition will do the same.
  answer: slippery slope (the argument suggests that allowing some athletes to use performance-enhancing drugs will inevitably lead to widespread drug use among all athletes.)

some argue that natural talent should be enough for an athlete's success, but genetic advantages are also unfair in sports.
  answer: appeal to nature (the assumption is that because something is 'natural,' it is morally superior or justified, which overlooks other important factors and considerations.)

it has been proven time and again that doping in sports leads to increased performance, so we should stop testing athletes altogether.
  answer: false causality (the argument mistakenly assumes that a correlation between doping and improved performance means that doping causes the improvement, without considering other factors that might contribute to success.)

banning substances like steroids is just a way for some athletes to gain an unfair advantage over others. everyone should be allowed to use whatever they want to win!
  answer: ad populum (the argument appeals to popular sentiment by presenting a position as widely accepted, thus making it seem valid without providing evidence or logical reasoning.)

if we don't drug test athletes, then we are sending the message that it's okay to cheat. this is bad for sports and sets a terrible example for young people.
  answer: appeal to fear (the argument uses the emotional impact of potential negative consequences to justify its position rather than providing logical reasoning or evidence.)

some say that drug testing athletes is a violation of their privacy rights, but surely athletes should have to follow rules when participating in competitions.
  answer: tu quoque (the argument deflects criticism by accusing the opponent of the same wrongdoing, rather than addressing the issue at hand.)

if a few athletes are caught doping, it means that most athletes must be clean. the fact that some athletes cheat does not mean they all do.
  answer: hasty generalization (the argument incorrectly assumes that because some athletes are found guilty of doping, it implies that most athletes are honest.)

some argue that drug testing athletes is just a way for big pharmaceutical companies to make more money by selling their tests and treatments.
  answer: appeal to conspiracy theories (the argument suggests a secretive plot or scheme without evidence to support the claim, making it fall under the category of appeals to conspiracy theories.)

it's unfair to drug test athletes while allowing big corporations to pollute our environment with impunity.

statement 2: ""if we legalize marijuana, then society will descend into chaos and addiction.""

2nd expert: 'slippery slope' - the argument assumes that a small change (legalizing marijuana) will inevitably lead to more significant problems (society-wide chaos and addiction).

statement 3: ""genetically modified organisms are bad because nature intended food to be natural.""

3rd expert: 'appeal to nature' - the argument is based on the idea that something created by humans (genetically modified organisms) is inherently wrong because it doesn't align with what occurs naturally.

statement 4: ""cigarettes cause cancer, so e-cigarettes must be just as bad.""

1st expert: 'false analogy' - the argument assumes that because two things share one characteristic (both are smoked), they must have all the same characteristics and effects.

statement 5: ""vaccines are dangerous, so we should not mandate them for children.""

2nd expert: 'ad populum' - the argument appeals to the emotions of the majority, suggesting that a popular belief (vaccines are dangerous) justifies action against it (not requiring vaccination for children).

statement 6: ""the president is a liar, so you should not believe anything he says.""

3rd expert: 'ad hominem' - the argument attacks the individual making the statement instead of addressing the validity of their arguments.
