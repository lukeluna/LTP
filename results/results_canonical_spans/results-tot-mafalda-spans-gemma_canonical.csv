**explanation:** the argument relies on its own premise (i.e., if any expert realizes they're wrong at any point then they leave) to support its conclusion that the experts must come to a final agreement. however, this premise is not logically valid. the fact that an expert realizes they are wrong about something does not mean they are wrong about everything else.",False,circular reasoning

Too bad other parents believed the same thing.",Appeal to Ridicule,"**answer:** appeal to ignorance.

**reasoning:** the argument assumes that all 14-year-olds are competent enough to handle firearms, regardless of their parental upbringing or potential for reckless behavior, solely because no one has witnessed a 14-year-old wielding a gun in public. this demonstrates a lack of awareness (ignorance) about the potential risks associated with such behavior rather than an actual logical reasoning process.",False,no match

**explanation:** the argument relies on the premise that liberals are better educated than conservatives. however, this premise is not provided or justified by any evidence or reasoning. the argument therefore commits a circular reasoning fallacy, where the conclusion (liberals are better educated) is supported by the premise itself, without any additional evidence or reasoning.",False,circular reasoning

**explanation:** the argument presents a hypothetical scenario involving multiple experts reaching a consensus through a collaborative process, implying that the conclusion is necessarily valid. this is an irrelevant and unnecessary elaboration of a hypothetical process to assess the validity of the premise. the actual consumption of dairy and red meat by people throughout history does not automatically establish their safety or effectiveness in building pyramids.",False,nothing

**explanation:** the argument suggests that the implementation of a state-run mass surveillance system is inevitable due to public support for measures like distracted driving mitigation. this ignores the fact that mass surveillance systems have various ethical and privacy implications that go beyond their potential use for combating distracted driving. the argument commits a slippery slope fallacy by exaggerating the potential consequences of a technology without providing sufficient evidence or reasoning to support the claim that its implementation will inevitably lead to more intrusive and oppressive measures.",False,slippery slope
