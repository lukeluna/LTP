Then a few months later we'll see people asking for a""creative"" mode so they can have access to all items in the game so they don't have to farm, and i dont think that sets a good example as a community for a game that we all love.",slippery slope,"'answer: slippery slope'

the reasoning behind this is that the argument posits a chain of events (start at 68, then 90, then creative mode) where each step is seen as a logical progression from the previous one. however, this assumption does not hold up in reality because not all players will necessarily follow this path once they have access to certain features or abilities. furthermore, the argument attempts to use this hypothetical chain of events to justify a negative conclusion about the community and its behavior, which is an unwarranted generalization based on a sequence of speculative assumptions.",True,slippery slope

2,"Someone once told me they have an""alt"" cause their main account was too high of rank to play with their friends. It's exactly the same as smurfing.",false analogy,"answer: equivocation
explanation: the term ""alt"" (alternate account) is being used in a non-standard way, which makes the argument misleading. in gaming context, an alt account is usually created for reasons other than playing with friends, such as boosting ranks or trying out new strategies. therefore, it's not exactly the same as smurfing (creating a lower-ranked account to play against less skilled players), even though there might be some similarities in motivation.",False,equivocation
3,Joe Biden will lose to Trump if he is the nominee. The Democratic party clearly has not learned the right lesson from Hillary Clinton's miserable failure.,guilt by association,"answer: false cause
explanation: the argument assumes that the loss of hillary clinton in 2016 was caused by a failure on the part of the democratic party to learn the ""right"" lesson, but this is unproven and not based on evidence or reason. instead, it relies on the premise that clinton's loss was due to a lack of learning, without any supporting evidence provided in the argument.",False,false causality

explanation: the argument relies on emotional language such as ""miserable failure"" and ""nobody wants..."" to make its point, rather than providing evidence or reason for the claim that joe biden will lose if he is the nominee. this is a fallacy where emotions are manipulated to support an argument without any real basis in evidence or reasoning.",False,appeal to emotion (level 1)
5,The Democratic party clearly has not learned the right lesson from Hillary Clinton's miserable failure. NOBODY WANTS ESTABLISHMENT POLITICIANS ANYMORE. NOBODY LIKES THE STATUS QUO.,ad populum,"answer: hasty generalization

explanation: the statement claims that ""nobody"" wants establishment politicians anymore and nobody likes the status quo based on hillary clinton's loss, which is a hasty generalization. it is not reasonable to assume that the preference of all people (i.e., ""nobody"") can be determined by a single political event or figure. additionally, the statement ignores other possible factors that may have influenced clinton's loss, such as her campaign strategy, personal scandals, and voter attitudes on various issues.",False,hasty generalization

9,"That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.",causal oversimplification,"answer: nothing (or possibly ""begging the question"", depending on how you interpret the statement)
explanation: while it may appear that the speaker is using a logical argument to justify their position, they are not actually providing any evidence or reasoning for why this period of the sixties requires america to move forward in every area. instead, they are simply stating their opinion without providing justification, and thus no fallacy is being committed. if, however, we interpret ""moving forward"" as synonymous with progress, and assume that the speaker believes that any progress made during the 60s must be considered good, then the statement could potentially be interpreted as a circular argument (begging the question). however, without further context or clarification from the speaker, it is impossible to definitively classify this statement as a fallacy.",False,circular reasoning

explanation: the argument relies on the assumption that four out of five dentists being in agreement is enough evidence to establish that happy glossy toothpaste is great. however, this does not account for potential conflicts of interest or other factors affecting the dentist's recommendation. moreover, it assumes that a majority opinion automatically equates to a reliable and accurate conclusion, which is not always the case.",False,appeal to (false) authority
12,Once they wear masks your anxiety will force you to demand the next step. biohazard suits? get real.,slippery slope,"answer: fallacy of equivocation

13,"The last Democrat winner of the New Hampshire primary won the general election. This year, the winner of the New Hampshire primary will win the general election.",causal oversimplification,"answer: fallacy of undistributed middle

explanation: the argument assumes that if a candidate wins the new hampshire primary in one election, they will necessarily win the general election in the same election. however, this does not take into account the possibility of other factors affecting the outcome of the general election (such as changes in public opinion or campaign strategies by other candidates). therefore, it is a fallacy where the middle term (the winning of the new hampshire primary) is not distributed to both extremes (winning and losing the general election), leaving an undistributed middle.",False,no match

This vice president has been an advocate for over a decade for lifting sanctions against Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet. It's a mistake.",false analogy,"answer: hasty generalization

explanation: the reasoning here is based on a small number of cases (north korea going from one to six to eight nuclear weapons) and is being used to make a broad statement about the vice president's stance on lifting sanctions against iran. it's possible that the vice president has valid reasons for advocating for lifting sanctions, but the argument presented here does not provide enough evidence or information to support this conclusion. the argument jumps to a conclusion too quickly without considering other factors.",False,hasty generalization
21,"This vice president has been an advocate for over a decade for lifting sanctions against Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet. It's a mistake.",guilt by association,"answer: appeal to authority (with a caveat)

explanation: the claim that iran is the ""largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet"" is being presented as fact by an authority figure (the vice president). however, in this scenario, we are only shown one step of the thinking process. to accurately classify this statement as a fallacy, we would need to know if the vice president has provided any supporting evidence or reasoning for this claim beyond simply stating their opinion as fact. without additional context, it is possible that the vice president's authority on the matter is being used correctly to present a legitimate claim backed by evidence, making it incorrect to classify this statement as an appeal to authority in this instance.",False,appeal to (false) authority

Their training program must be efficient, effective, and highly-regarded.",causal oversimplification,"answer: appeal to authority (specifically, appeal to unqualified experts)
explanation: the claim relies on the assumption that if the individuals involved are experts in a certain field, their group project will also be excellent in the same field, without providing any evidence or reasoning for this assumption. this is a fallacy because it assumes that authority (the psychologists) automatically qualifies the product (the psychology training program), which is not necessarily true.",False,appeal to (false) authority

Plot twist!,hasty generalization,"answer: nothing (or possibly appeal to stereotype, if we interpret ""the far left"" as referring to a specific group with a stereotypical belief)
the statement does not present an argument and therefore it's not possible to classify it as a fallacy. it simply states an observation about a hypothetical situation without providing any premises or conclusions. if we interpret ""the far left"" as referring to a specific group, then the statement could potentially be considered an appeal to stereotype if the implication is that this group holds a certain belief. however, since the statement does not provide evidence or reasoning to support this claim, it is not possible to definitively classify it as a fallacy in this case.",False,nothing

explanation: the statement asks for an explanation as to why certain individuals are convinced about something (the urgency and magnitude of climate change), but does not provide any supporting evidence or reasoning for this belief itself. instead, it implies that the reader should already know the reasons for this belief. however, in a formal argument, one should always provide reasons and evidence for their beliefs, not simply ask others to guess them. by doing so, the statement commits the fallacy of asking a question rather than making a clear argument or claim with supporting reasoning.",False,no match

explanation: the argument relies on the assumption that because animals kill each other for food and it is natural, humans should also do the same without consideration for suffering. this is a fallacy where an argument is made based on the fact that something is natural or common in nature as justification for a behavior or belief. in this case, the appeal to nature fallacy ignores ethical and moral considerations that are not present in animal behaviors and should be considered when making decisions about human actions.",True,appeal to nature

explanation: the arguer generalizes that all pro-vaxxers do not have an informed opinion based on the assumption that only those who oppose them (anti-vaxxers) are capable of having an informed opinion. this is a hasty generalization because it makes assumptions about the entire group without sufficient evidence or reasoning to support the claim.",False,hasty generalization

explanation: the reasoning here is that the support for the campaign comes from retired military personnel and businesspeople, some of whom are republicans. this implies that if one wants to change, they should also support this campaign. however, this argument assumes that these individuals are authorities on the topic at hand (change) simply because of their former positions or political affiliations. additionally, it suggests that support for the campaign is a measure of whether someone wants to change or not, which is a form of argumentum ad baculum (appeal to force or authority), as it attempts to manipulate the audience by implying that not supporting the campaign equates to a lack of desire for change.",False,appeal to (false) authority

explanation: the person is making a conclusion based on a single event without establishing that there was a cause-effect relationship between going to the movies and passing the math test. in other words, it is not established that watching a movie would consistently result in passing a math test, so going to the movies before every math test does not guarantee the same result.",False,false causality

explanation: the fallacy of equivocation occurs when a term is used with more than one meaning during an argument, and this misuse affects the logic of the argument. in this case, ""compassion"" is being used to mean both a virtuous quality (the first use) and an action that leads to sin (the second use). the two uses of the term are not equivalent, and this ambiguity undermines the logical structure of the argument.",False,equivocation

explanation: the argument assumes that the effect of seeing a tv commercial on the audience is directly related to their memory of it. however, this assumption has not been proven or justified in any way. it is possible that other factors could have contributed to the increased memory recall of the tv commercial, such as the quality of the content, the timing of the ad, or the overall context in which it was shown. therefore, it is fallacious to attribute the increased memory recall solely to the medium (tv) without considering these potential confounding variables.",False,no match
88,This is a ridiculous post and this mechanic will never be changed. Seat switching has always been a BF mechanic.,appeal to tradition,"the statement does not present a fallacy, as it does not make an argument or provide premises for an argument. it merely states a hypothetical scenario without any claim to be proven or disproven. so the answer is: 'answer: nothing'.",False,nothing
89,Dont sit here and try and talk about realism or how you shouldnt be able to swap instantly between seats when there is hardly anything realistic about BF vehicle play in general.,Appeal to Ridicule,"answer: nothing (this statement does not present a fallacy, but rather a commentary on the nature of the game itself.)",False,nothing
90,Sounds like you need to get better if you are having trouble shooting down the most vulnerable aircraft in the sky.,Appeal to Ridicule,"answer: false dilemma. this statement presents a simplified choice between ""getting better"" and being unable to shoot down an aircraft, implying that there is no other option. however, there may be other possibilities such as not engaging with aircrafts or focusing on other aspects of skill improvement.",False,false dilemma
91,"Social media is the worst. People don't realize how much of an effect it has on someone, especially his generation.",hasty generalization,"answer: circular reasoning

explanation: the argument relies on a premise that ""people don't realize"" about social media (that it negatively affects young people), but the conclusion is that social media is bad because it has a negative effect on young people. this creates a circle in reasoning, as the conclusion supports the premise and vice versa.",False,circular reasoning
92,Anyone in the public eye who has any sort of mental health issue should rid themselves of their accounts if they possibly can.,false dilemma,"the statement presents a type of argument known as an 'appeal to shame'. in this case, the argument is trying to make the claim that someone in the public eye with a mental health issue should hide or remove their accounts based on the notion that it is shameful to have a mental health issue and present oneself publicly. this is incorrect, as having a mental health issue is not shameful and should not be used as a reason to hide one's identity or presence online.

the reasoning behind this answer is that the argument relies on emotions (shame) to make its case, rather than providing evidence or facts to support the conclusion. the use of emotional manipulation in an argument can lead to flawed conclusions and unjustified actions, as seen in this example.

so, the answer would be 'answer: appeal to shame'.",False,no match

95,"Bill, you drive a beat-up car from the 1980s. For this reason, we can never allow you to be a lifeguard at the community pool.",ad hominem,"answer: false cause fallacy

explanation: the argument states that because someone drives an old car, they cannot be a lifeguard. however, there is no logical connection between the two facts. driving an old car does not inherently make someone unsuitable for the role of a lifeguard. therefore, it is a fallacy where cause and effect are incorrectly assumed.",False,false causality

97,"If you give the government *any* control over what is considered""hate speech"", you are basically relinquishing your freedom of speech. It's a slippery slope.

Next thing you know, your own government has full power to censor this""hate"", and you are persecuted simply for disagreeing with the laws of an ally nation.

Don't ever relinquish your freedoms willingly.",appeal to fear,answer: slippery slope fallacy,False,slippery slope
98,Governments have shown time and time again that they are more than happy to censor and abuse their peoples.,hasty generalization,"answer: argument from ignorance
explanation: the statement implies that since governments have shown a history of censorship and abuse, it is reasonable to assume that they will always do so in the future. however, this logic is based on the premise that if something has happened once or multiple times, it will necessarily happen again in the future without further evidence or reasoning. this fallacy is also known as ""appeal to ignorance"" because it assumes that a claim is true merely because it has not been proven false. in this case, the assumption that governments will always abuse their people is not supported by enough evidence to be certain.",False,no match
99,That means it must be really good!,ad populum,"'answer: fallacy of circular reasoning'

107,Good thing CA is able to focus on this hugely important issue and doesn't have massive homelessness plaguing it's cities or an ever increasing affordable housing crisis to worry about.,appeal to worse problems,"'answer: appeal to ignorance'
explanation: the statement implies that because a certain problem (homelessness, affordable housing crisis) is not present in ca, it allows the state to focus on other issues. however, this reasoning overlooks the possibility that ca might have effective solutions for these problems and therefore does not need to worry about them, rather than the fact they are simply not present. the argument assumes that if a problem is not evident or visible, then it can be ignored, which is a fallacy known as appeal to ignorance.",False,no match

110,And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.,appeal to fear,"answer: false dilemma

explanation: the statement presents only two options, ""the same failed policies and the same failed politics"" or something different, but it does not consider any other alternatives that may exist in between these extremes. thus, it is a fallacy where only two choices are presented yet more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes.",False,false dilemma

We have an administration that is demolishing public housing in our inner cities and not providing anything else but more public housing.,appeal to anger,"answer: appeal to emotion (specifically, appeal to sympathy)
explanation: the argument appeals to the listener's emotions, specifically their empathy towards families who are hurting, people who are unemployed, homeless, or living in poor conditions, and those who have had property demolished. by doing so, it attempts to sway the audience's judgement without providing any objective evidence to support its claim.",False,appeal to emotion (level 1)

explanation: the statement is using ""the los angeles times"" as an authority on how government spending is measured and the level it will reach under the budget plan. however, the la times may not be an objective or authoritative source on this matter, and the statement does not provide any other evidence or reasoning to support its claim. instead, it is simply citing a source that the speaker believes will be accepted as authority by the audience, without actually demonstrating why that source should be trusted in this case. this is a fallacy because it relies on an untrustworthy or biased source as the basis for its argument.",False,appeal to (false) authority

133,"These test results are clearly wrong, and it must be either because the client was malingering or because I bungled the test administration.",false dilemma,"answer: fallacy of false cause

140,"I went veg because factory farming is horribly unnatural, but I can't really come up with an argument against hunting based on what made me go veg...",appeal to nature,"answer: equivocation

explanation: the arguer is using the term ""unnatural"" in two different senses. in the first instance, it refers to factory farming, which is a human-created industrial practice. in the second instance, it is being used to imply that hunting is not a natural way for humans to obtain food, but this is not necessarily true as hunting was historically a part of many human cultures before the advent of agriculture. therefore, the arguer's reasoning is based on an ambiguous term with more than one sense, making the argument misleading.",False,equivocation
141,"I'm vegan, I'll never part take in this activity, but I don't feel like hunting for fun should be considered a mental illness.

explanation: the argument suggests that the ""over-complication of nutrition"" is a major cause of the obesity epidemic in america. however, the statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. it simply asserts that over-complicated nutrition is the problem without explaining how or why it leads to obesity. therefore, the argument is fallacious because it presents an unsubstantiated cause for a phenomenon without any supporting evidence.",False,false causality

explanation: the statement does not present a fallacy because it does not use logical errors or invalid reasoning to make an argument. however, if the speaker is implying that the over-complication of nutrition is the main cause of obesity in america without presenting any evidence, then it could be considered an ""argument from ignorance"" (ignorantia juris non excusat), where one assumes something to be true because it has not been proven false. in this case, though, the statement does not explicitly assert that the over-complication of nutrition is the main cause without presenting evidence or reasoning, so it remains unclear whether an argument from ignorance is being presented.",False,nothing
