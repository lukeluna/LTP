5,The Democratic party clearly has not learned the right lesson from Hillary Clinton's miserable failure. NOBODY WANTS ESTABLISHMENT POLITICIANS ANYMORE. NOBODY LIKES THE STATUS QUO.,ad populum,"answer: appeal to majority

step 1: the statement makes a claim about what the majority of people want or don't want, implying that it is a fact. however, this is an assumption and not based on actual evidence or data. this can be considered as a form of logical fallacy known as an ""appeal to majority"" or ""bandwagon fallacy.""

explanation: the statement is making an argument based on the recommendation from a majority of the dentists surveyed, which implies that these experts have determined that happy glossy toothpaste is better than other options. this fallacy occurs when one appeals to a person or people who are assumed to be reliable or qualified, but their actual credibility in relation to the argument at hand has not been proven or verified. in this case, it's not clear whether these dentists have any particular expertise or experience with happy glossy toothpaste. therefore, it is a fallacy where an alleged authority is used as evidence in your argument when the authority is not really an authority on the facts relevant to the argument.

explanation: the argument seems to be appealing to ""natural"" as if what is natural is inherently good or correct, rather than looking at evidence for the health effects of refined sugar. therefore, it is a fallacy where a person believes something is true because it's natural, instead of looking at the facts and scientific evidence.

step 1: the speaker claims that balance can't include any refined sugar at all because we weren't able to process it before the food pyramid came around.
step 2: the speaker suggests that historical context should inform our modern understanding of what constitutes a balanced diet.
step 3: the speaker assumes that pre-food pyramid diets were inherently healthier, which may not be true for various reasons (e.g., shorter life expectancy, different environmental factors, etc.).
step 4: the speaker uses the appeal to nature fallacy by assuming that something is true because it's natural, instead of looking at evidence-based facts.

explanation: the statement uses a chain reaction to draw a conclusion, assuming that if one event did not occur, then a series of subsequent events would not occur either. this is an oversimplification and does not take into account the complexity of real-world situations or the possibility of other factors influencing the outcome. therefore, it is a fallacy where it assumes a direct, linear connection between events without considering that other factors could have influenced the outcome.
