the speaker seems to be assuming that if players start at level 68, then eventually they will want to start at level 90, and later demand a ""creative"" mode where they don't have to farm for items. this is not necessarily true, as players may have different preferences and desires. the argument assumes a linear progression based on past trends, but it is possible that the community could evolve in other ways or maintain satisfaction with the existing gameplay.",True,slippery slope

170,Dairy and red meat are fine - people have been consuming them for centuries and they did shit like building pyramids using just their hands.,appeal to tradition,"the given segment demonstrates the fallacy of appeal to tradition. this fallacy involves asserting that a claim is valid because it has been followed or occurred in the past, disregarding whether it is relevant or suitable for the current situation. in this case, the argument suggests that consuming dairy and red meat is acceptable because people have consumed them historically, without considering other factors such as nutritional requirements, ethical considerations, or modern scientific understanding.",True,appeal to tradition
171,"You don't need to live off of bland chicken breasts, broccoli, and scrambled eggs to be healthy.",straw man,"the segment exhibits an example of the hasty generalization fallacy. this type of logical error takes place when a conclusion is derived from a limited set of evidence or a small sample size. in this instance, the argument makes a generalization about what constitutes a healthy diet by focusing on a narrow range of food options, without considering the wider selection of nutritious foods that could also contribute to a balanced and healthy lifestyle.",False,hasty generalization
172,I think one of the biggest reasons for the obesity epidemic in America is the over-complication of nutrition.,causal oversimplification,"the segment demonstrates the presence of the straw man fallacy. this fallacy is characterized by misrepresenting or oversimplifying an opponent's argument in order to more easily refute it, rather than addressing the original argument itself. in this case, the statement suggests that over-complication is the main cause of the obesity epidemic in america, without considering other contributing factors or the complexity of nutrition as a whole.",False,straw man

It may seem innocuous and even helpful at first but the implications are tremendous. These are the first steps towards mass facial recognition and social credit systems... and people are clamoring for it.,appeal to fear,"the segment appears to contain the fallacy of slippery slope. this logical error involves arguing that a seemingly small action or event will inevitably lead to more serious, often catastrophic outcomes, without providing enough evidence or justification for this belief.",False,slippery slope
175,The Cardinals are the best football team because they're better than all the other teams. They're better than all the other teams because they're the best.,circular reasoning,"the given segment exhibits the fallacy of circular reasoning. this fallacy takes place when the conclusion is inherent within the premise, resulting in an argument that goes in circles. in this instance, the assertion ""they're better than all other teams because they're the best"" essentially reiterates the initial claim (""the cardinals are the best football team"") without presenting any further proof or justification for the statement.",True,circular reasoning

177,Fast food isn't fueling the obesity epidemic; FOOD is fueling the obesity epidemic.,causal oversimplification,"the segment contains the fallacy of oversimplification. this fallacy occurs when a complex issue is reduced to a single cause, which in this case is food. in reality, the obesity epidemic is influenced by various factors such as genetics, diet, physical activity, and socioeconomic status. by stating that ""food"" is the sole cause of the obesity epidemic, the segment oversimplifies the issue and fails to consider the multifaceted nature of the problem.",False,causal oversimplification
178,Let's not forget Genetically Modified foods. They are not on our food chain.,appeal to nature,"the segment includes the fallacy of appeal to nature. this fallacy occurs when an argument is presented based on the notion that something is good because it is 'natural' or bad because it is 'unnatural.' in this context, the speaker suggests that genetically modified foods are undesirable because they diverge from what is considered 'natural,' without considering other aspects such as safety and efficiency.",True,appeal to nature
179,"Yeah, I always go to religious organizations to supply me with clear and objective scientific studies...",Appeal to Ridicule,"the segment demonstrates an instance of the false cause fallacy, also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc. this fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because one event occurred before another, the first event must have caused the second. in this case, the speaker is assuming that religious organizations are a source for objective scientific information, without providing any reasoning or evidence to support this claim.",False,false causality

181,"I propose that for a modern account of a miracle, if the person telling you the account is trustworthy, that is a reason to take the account seriously.",appeal to (false) authority,"the segment demonstrates the fallacy of appeal to credibility. this fallacy transpires when an argument's validity relies solely on the credibility or authority of the source conveying it, instead of examining the strengths of the argument itself. here, the argument posits that since the person narrating the account of a miracle is trustworthy, their account should be considered seriously without any additional assessment or evidence.",False,appeal to (false) authority
